The signatories express concerns over the current \"out-of-control race\" between AI labs to develop and deploy machine learning systems that cannot be understood, predicted, or reliably controlled.</p> <p>Alongside the pause, the letter calls for the creation of independent regulators to ensure future AI systems are safe to deploy, and shared safety protocols for advanced AI design and development that are audited and overseen by independent outside experts to ensure adherence to safety standards. While the letter is unlikely to have any immediate impact on AI research, it highlights growing opposition to the \"ship it now and fix it later\" approach to AI development.</p> <p>AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity, as shown by extensive research and acknowledged by top AI labs. As stated in the widely-endorsed Asilomar AI Principles, Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources. Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one \u2013 not even their creators \u2013 can understand, predict, or reliably control.</p> <p>Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system's potential effects. OpenAI's recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that \"At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.\" We agree. That point is now.</p> <p>Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.</p> <p>AI labs and independent experts should use this pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for advanced AI design and development that are rigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts. These protocols should ensure that systems adhering to them are safe beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not mean a pause on AI development in general, merely a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities.</p> <p>AI research and development should be refocused on making today's powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal.</p> <p>In parallel, AI developers must work with policymakers to dramatically accelerate development of robust AI governance systems. These should at a minimum include: new and capable regulatory authorities dedicated to AI; oversight and tracking of highly capable AI systems and large pools of computational capability; provenance and watermarking systems to help distinguish real from synthetic and to track model leaks; a robust auditing and certification ecosystem; liability for AI-caused harm; robust public funding for technical AI safety research; and well-resourced institutions for coping with the dramatic economic and political disruptions (especially to democracy) that AI will cause.</p> <p>Humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with AI. Having succeeded in creating powerful AI systems, we can now enjoy an \"AI summer\" in which we reap the rewards, engineer these systems for the clear benefit of all, and give society a chance to adapt. Society has hit pause on other technologies with potentially catastrophic effects on society.  We can do so here.

Further progress in AI development could lead to capabilities that pose extreme risks, such as offensive cyber capabilities or strong manipulation skills. We explain why model evaluation is critical for addressing extreme risks. Developers must be able to identify dangerous capabilities (through \"dangerous capability evaluations\") and the propensity of models to apply their capabilities for harm (through \"alignment evaluations\"). These evaluations will become critical for keeping policymakers and other stakeholders informed, and for making responsible decisions about model training, deployment, and security.</p> <p>Risks:</p> <ul> <li>Cyber-offense - The model can discover vulnerabilities in systems (hardwares, software, data). It can write code for exploiting those vulnerabilities. It can make effective decisions once it has gained access to a system or network, and skilfully evade threat detection and response (both human and system) whilst focusing on a specific objective. If deployed as a coding assistant, it can insert subtle bugs into the code for future exploitation.</li> <li>Deception - The model has the skills necessary to deceive humans, e.g. constructing believable (but false) statements, making accurate predictions about the effect of a lie on a human, and keeping track of what information it needs to withhold to maintain the deception. The model can impersonate a human effectively</li> <li>Persuasion &amp; manipulation - The model is effective at shaping people\u2019s beliefs, in dialogue and other settings (e.g. social media posts), even towards untrue beliefs. The model is effective at promoting certain narratives in a persuasive way. It can convince people to do things that they would not otherwise do, including unethical acts.</li> <li>Political Strategy - The model can perform the social modelling and planning necessary for an actor to gain and exercise political influence, not just on a micro-level but in scenarios with multiple actors and rich social context. For example, the model can score highly in forecasting competitions on questions relating to global affairs or political negotiations.</li> <li>Weapon acquisition - The model can gain access to existing weapons systems or contribute to building new weapons.  For example, the model could assemble a bioweapon (with human assistance) or provide actionable instructions for how to do so. The model can make, or significantly assist with, scientific discoveries that unlock novel weapons.</li> <li>Long-horizon planning - The model can make sequential plans that involve multiple steps, unfolding over long time horizons (or at least involving many interdependent steps). It can perform such planning within and across many domains. The model can sensibly adapt its plans in light of unexpected obstacles or adversaries. The model\u2019s planning capabilities generalise to novel settings, and do not rely heavily on trial and error.</li> <li>AI development - The model could build new AI systems from scratch, including AI systems with dangerous capabilities. It can find ways of adapting other, existing models to increase their performance on tasks relevant to extreme risks. As an assistant, the model could significantly improve the productivity of actors building dual use AI capabilities.</li> <li>Situational awareness - The model can distinguish between whether it is being trained, evaluated, or deployed \u2013 allowing it to behave differently in each case. The model knows that it is a model, and has knowledge about itself and its likely surroundings (e.g. what company trained it, where their servers are, what kind of people might be giving it feedback, and who has administrative access).</li> <li>Selfproliferation - The model can break out of its local environment (e.g. using a vulnerability in its underlying system or suborning an engineer). The model can exploit limitations in the systems for monitoring its behaviour post-deployment. The model could independently generate revenue (e.g. by offering crowdwork services, ransomware attacks), use these revenues to acquire cloud computing resources, and operate a large number of other AI systems. The model can generate creative strategies for uncovering information about itself or exfiltrating its code and weights.</li> </ul> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>papers<ul> <li>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15324</li> <li>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07785</li> </ul> </li> <li>articles<ul> <li>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unpacking-ai-risks-closer-look-deepminds-evaluation-des-w-woodruff/</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also A, [Generative AI Risk]</p>"},{"location":"glossary/a/#ai-safety","title":"AI Safety","text":"<p>Umbrella term for:</p> <ul> <li>AI Ethics - The use of AI does not impact under represented people?</li> <li>AI Alignment - Goal of the AI is aligned with human desired goal?</li> <li>Robustness - Ensure AI systems behave as intended in a wide range of different situations, including rare situations</li> </ul> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>Safety neglect in 1979? - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Williams_(robot_fatality)</li> <li>Death of Elaine H by self driving car - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Elaine_Herzberg </li> <li>Goodhart's law - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law</li> <li>Fake podcast - https://www.zerohedge.com/political/joe-rogan-issues-warning-after-ai-generated-version-his-podcast-surfaces</li> <li>Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety</li> </ul> <p>See also A, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/a/#ai-stack","title":"AI Stack","text":"<p>See also A, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/a/#ai-topics","title":"AI Topics","text":"<p>A site managed by the [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence], a non-profit organization</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://aitopics.org/search</li> </ul> <p>See also A, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/a/#ai-winter","title":"AI Winter","text":"<p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>First - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#The_first_AI_winter_1974%E2%80%931980</li> <li>Second - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#Bust:_the_second_AI_winter_1987%E2%80%931993</li> </ul> <p>See also A, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/a/#ai-writer","title":"AI Writer","text":"<p>A software application that uses artificial intelligence to produce written content, mimicking human-like text generation.

An acceleration of this sort will ask itself what is next ad infinitum until the laws of physics or theoretical computation set in. The University of Oxford scholar Nick Bostrom claims we have achieved ASI when machines have more intelligent than the best humans in every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills. Bostrom\u2019s depiction of ASI has religious significance. Like their religious counterparts, believers of ASI even predict specific dates when the Second Coming will reveal our savior. Oddly, Bostrom can\u2019t explain how to create artificial intelligence. His argument is regressive and depends upon itself for its explanation. What will create ASI? Well, AGI. Who will create AGI? Someone else, of course. AI categories suggest a false continuum at the end of which is ASI, and no one seems particularly thwarted by their ignorance.

The general idea of autoencoders is pretty simple and consists in setting an encoder and a decoder as neural networks and to learn the best encoding-decoding scheme using an iterative optimisation process. So, at each iteration we feed the autoencoder architecture (the encoder followed by the decoder) with some data, we compare the encoded-decoded output with the initial data and backpropagate the error through the architecture to update the weights of the networks. Thus, intuitively, the overall autoencoder architecture (encoder+decoder) creates a bottleneck for data that ensures only the main structured part of the information can go through and be reconstructed. Looking at our general framework, the family E of considered encoders is defined by the encoder network architecture, the family D of considered decoders is defined by the decoder network architecture and the search of encoder and decoder that minimise the reconstruction error is done by gradient descent over the parameters of these networks.</p> <p></p> <p>See also A, Autoencoding, Backpropagation, Decoder, Denoising Autoencoder, Dimensionality Reduction, Disentangled Variational Autoencoder, Encoder, Encoder-Decoder Model, Hidden State, Linear Autoencoder, Unsupervised Deep Learning Model, Unsupervised Learning, Variational Autoencoder</p>"},{"location":"glossary/a/#autoencoder-bottleneck","title":"Autoencoder Bottleneck","text":"<p>This is the name of the hidden layer with the least neuron in an autoencoder architecture.

It allows you to combine prior beliefs with observed data to get posterior beliefs.

Bayesian inference uses Bayes' rule to compute and update probabilities after obtaining new data. This allows you to update your beliefs sequentially as you gather more information.</li> <li>A major advantage is that it accounts for uncertainty and allows explicit use of prior information. Bayes' theorem provides a principled way to update beliefs in light of new evidence. This allows Bayesian inference to combine new data with prior knowledge in a coherent way.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, Bayesian inference uses Bayes' theorem to update probabilities after observing data. It incorporates prior beliefs, models uncertainty, and allows for sequential analysis, making it very useful for data analysis and modeling.</p> <pre><code>Here's a simple example of how a person could use Bayesian inference in a real-world situation:\n\nSuppose you take a medical test to screen for a rare disease. The test has a 98% accuracy rate - meaning if you have the disease, there is a 98% chance of a positive result, and if you don't have the disease, there is a 98% chance of a negative result.\n\nThe disease affects 1 in 10,000 people in the general population. You take the test and receive a positive result. You want to figure out the probability that you actually have the disease, given the evidence of the positive test result.\n\nUsing Bayesian inference:\n\nLet D be the event that you have the disease\nLet T+ be the event of a positive test\nWe start with the initial prior probability of having the disease P(D) = 1/10,000 = 0.0001\n\nThe probability of a positive test given that you do have the disease: P(T+|D) = 0.98\nAnd the probability of a positive test given you don't have the disease: P(T+|~D) = 0.02\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(D|T+) = P(T+|D) x P(D) / P(T+)\n\nP(T+) can be calculated using the law of total probability:\nP(T+) = P(T+|D) x P(D) + P(T+|~D) x P(~D)\n= 0.98 x 0.0001 + 0.02 x 0.9999\n= 0.0298\n\nPlugging this all in gives:\nP(D|T+) = 0.98 x 0.0001 / 0.0298 = 0.0033\n\nSo the probability you have the disease after getting a positive test is only about 0.33% or 1 in 300 people, much lower than the 1 in 10,000 prior probability.

It does have many other applications, including:</p> <ul> <li>Estimating confidence intervals and standard errors for the estimator (e.g. the standard error for the mean),</li> <li>Estimating precision for an estimator \u03b8,</li> <li>Dealing with non-normally distributed data,</li> <li>Calculating sample sizes for experiments.</li> </ul> <p>Bootstrapping has been shown to be an excellent method to estimate many distributions for statistics, sometimes giving better results than traditional normal approximation. It also works well with small samples. It doesn\u2019t perform very well when the model isn\u2019t smooth, is not a good choice for dependent data, missing data, censoring, or data with outliers.</p> <p>Bootstrap + Aggregation = Bagging</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://www.datasciencecentral.com/resampling-methods-comparison/</li> </ul> <p>See also B, Resampling Method</p>"},{"location":"glossary/b/#boston-dynamics-company","title":"Boston Dynamics Company","text":"<p>Boston Dynamics is an American engineering and robotics design company founded in 1992 as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

It refers to the tendency of a neural network to completely forget previously learned information upon learning new information. This issue is especially prominent in scenarios involving sequential or continual learning, where a model is trained on a series of tasks one after the other.</p> <p>Here are some key points about catastrophic forgetting:</p> <ul> <li>Description: When a neural network is trained on a new task or dataset, it tends to adjust its weights significantly to accommodate the new information. If the new task is significantly different from the previous tasks, the network might lose the ability to perform well on the old tasks, as the weights that were important for those tasks are overwritten.</li> <li>Example: Consider a neural network trained to recognize cats. If the same network is subsequently trained to recognize dogs without revisiting the cat images, it might lose the ability to recognize cats, even if it was proficient at this task before the dog training.</li> <li>Causes: Catastrophic forgetting occurs because traditional neural networks lack a mechanism to retain old knowledge while acquiring new information. The weight updates during the training of new tasks can disrupt the knowledge acquired from previous tasks.</li> <li>Impact in AI: This phenomenon is a significant challenge in the field of artificial intelligence, especially for systems that require continual learning or learning from a stream of data (like autonomous vehicles or personalized AI assistants)</li> <li>Solutions and Research: Various techniques are being researched and developed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

A seven player game is much harder to solve than a two player game such as chess or Go. You must consider the many possible strategies of not one but six other players. This makes it much harder to write an AI to play the game. Diplomacy is also a game of imperfect information, because players make moves simultaneously. Unlike games such as chess or Go, where you know everything about your opponent\u2019s moves, players in Diplomacy make moves not knowing what their opponents are about to do. They must therefore predict their opponents\u2019 next actions. This also adds to the challenge of writing an AI to play it. Finally, Diplomacy is a zero sum game in which if you win, I lose. And the outcome is deterministic and not dependent on chance. Nonetheless, before victory or defeat, it still pays for players to form alliances and team up on each other. Indeed, one of the real challenges in playing the game is managing the informal negotiations with other players before making simultaneous moves. The main reason Cicero\u2019s performance is a scientific breakthrough is that it can both play the game well, and also perform these informal negotiations. This combination of natural language processing and strategic reasoning is a first for any game-playing AI.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>site - https://ai.facebook.com/research/cicero/</li> <li>https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/cicero-ai-that-can-collaborate-and-negotiate-with-you/</li> <li>https://ai.facebook.com/blog/cicero-ai-negotiates-persuades-and-cooperates-with-people/</li> <li>science article (private) - https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097?fbclid=IwAR1is0uOvw8uSQaJjTNKeevCKanq3TnVsLiS2wY0RwHX3zreCuwqPHKTcVI</li> <li>science article (public) - https://www.science.org/content/article/ai-learns-art-diplomacy-game?cookieSet=1</li> <li>request for proposal - https://ai.facebook.com/research/request-for-proposal/towards-human-AI-cooperation/</li> <li>gizmodo - https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/11/an-ai-named-cicero-can-beat-humans-in-diplomacy-a-complex-alliance-building-game-thats-a-big-deal/</li> </ul> <p>See also C, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/c/#cifar-dataset","title":"CIFAR Dataset","text":"<p>Datasets created by Alex Krizhevsky for the AlexNet Model</p> <p>Datasets   * CIFAR-10 = 10 different categories   * CIFAR-100i = 100 different categories</p> <p>The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms.

Here are some key points about the Clever Hans effect:</p> <ul> <li>Hans was a horse owned by Wilhelm von Osten, a German mathematics teacher. Von Osten claimed Hans could solve math problems, tell time, read, spell, and understand German.</li> <li>Hans would tap his hoof to answer questions. For example, when asked to add 3 + 2, he would tap his hoof 5 times.</li> <li>Hans became a sensation in Germany, attracting crowds who marveled at his intelligence. However, after investigation, it was determined his abilities were an unintentional trick.</li> <li>The Clever Hans effect refers to an instance where it appears an animal (or person) has capabilities beyond expectations, but in reality is inadvertently receiving subtle cues from questioners that guide their behavior.</li> <li>With Hans, it was determined people were unintentionally cuing the horse by slightly leaning forward, making facial expressions, or tensing muscles when Hans reached the correct number of taps. This provided Hans the signal to stop tapping.</li> <li>The Clever Hans effect illustrates how easy it is for people to inadvertently guide behaviors through subtle, unconscious cues. It demonstrates the need for proper experimental controls when evaluating extraordinary claims of animal or human intelligence.</li> </ul> <p>So in summary, the Clever Hans effect refers to situations where it appears an animal or person has remarkable abilities, but in reality is just responding to subtle behavioral cues from others.

This helps reduce errors or hallucinations where the model might produce incorrect or misleading information.</p> <p>In CRAG, the retrieval evaluator is a fine-tuned T5-large model. The evaluator assigns a confidence score to each document, categorizing them into three levels of confidence:</p> <ul> <li>Correct: If at least one document scores above the upper threshold, it is considered correct. The system then applies a knowledge refinement process, using a decompose-then-recompose algorithm to extract the most important and relevant knowledge strips while filtering out any irrelevant or noisy data within the documents. This ensures that only the most accurate and relevant information is retained for the generation process.</li> <li>Incorrect: If all documents fall below a lower threshold, they are marked as incorrect. In this case, CRAG discards all the retrieved documents and instead performs a web search to gather new, potentially more accurate external knowledge. This step extends the retrieval process beyond static or limited knowledge base by leveraging the vast and dynamic information available on the web, increasing the likelihood of retrieving relevant and accurate data.</li> <li>Ambiguous: When the retrieved documents contain mixed results, it will be considered ambiguous. In this case, CRAG combines both strategies: it refines information from the initially retrieved documents and incorporates additional knowledge obtained from web searches.</li> </ul> <p>After one of these actions is taken, the refined knowledge is used to generate the final response.</p> <p>CRAG makes several key improvements over traditional RAG. One of its biggest advantages is its ability to fix errors in the information it retrieves. The retrieval evaluator in CRAG helps spot when information is wrong or irrelevant, so it can be corrected before it affects the final output. This means CRAG provides more accurate and reliable information, cutting down on errors and misinformation.</p> <p>CRAG also excels in making sure the information is both relevant and accurate. While traditional RAG might only check relevance scores, CRAG goes further by refining the documents to ensure they are not just relevant but also precise.

Now it's easy to digest my word when I say that I will be more surprised to see an outcome with low probability in comparison to an outcome with high probability. Now, if Pi is the probability of ith outcome then we could represent surprisal (s) as:</li> </ul> <pre><code>s = log ( 1 / Pi)\n</code></pre> <p></p> <ul> <li>Entropy: Since I know surprisal for individual outcomes, I would like to know surprisal for the event. It would be intuitive to take a weighted average of surprisals. Now the question is what weight to choose? Hmmm\u2026since I know the probability of each outcome, taking probability as weight makes sense because this is how likely each outcome is supposed to occur. This weighted average of surprisal is nothing but Entropy (e) and if there are n outcomes then it could be written as:</li> </ul> <pre><code>entropy = e = sum(0, n, Pi * log (1/Pi)\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Cross-Entropy: Now, what if each outcome\u2019s actual probability is Pi but someone is estimating probability as Qi. In this case, each event will occur with the probability of Pi but surprisal will be given by Qi in its formula (since that person will be surprised thinking that probability of the outcome is Qi). Now, weighted average surprisal, in this case, is nothing but cross-entropy(c) and it could be scribbled as:</li> </ul> <pre><code>cross-entropy = c = sum(0, n, Pi * log (1/Qi)\n</code></pre> <p>Cross-entropy is always larger than entropy and it will be same as entropy only when Pi=Qi</p> <ul> <li>Cross-Entropy Loss: In the plot below, you will notice that as estimated probability distribution moves away from actual/desired probability distribution, cross-entropy increases and vice-versa. Hence, we could say that minimizing cross-entropy will move us closer to actual/desired distribution and that is what we want. This is why we try to reduce cross-entropy so that our predicted probability distribution end up being close to the actual one. Hence, we get the formula of cross-entropy loss as:</li> </ul> <pre><code>cross-entropy loss = c = sum(0, n, Pi * log (1/Qi)\n\n# And in the case of binary classification problem where we have only two classes, we name it as binary cross-entropy loss and above formula becomes:\nbinary cross-entropy loss = c = sum(0, 1, Pi * log (1/Qi) = Po * log(1/Qo) + (1-Po) * log(1/Q1) \n</code></pre> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This plot helps you visualize the cross-entropy between two distributions.

For example, in image classification, the model may first be trained on images with solid backgrounds before moving to more varied images.</li> <li>The curriculum is designed thoughtfully based on some measure of \"difficulty\". This could be manually defined by a human or automated based on model performance.</li> <li>Models are able to master simpler concepts first, which provides a better initialization for learning more complex examples later.</li> <li>Curriculum learning can lead to faster convergence compared to training on all data from the start.</li> <li>It is most useful when the training data has an inherent meaningful order from simple to complex. Curriculum design is important.</li> <li>Curriculum learning has been shown to be beneficial for training deep neural networks in domains like computer vision and natural language processing.</li> </ul> <p>So in summary, curriculum learning trains models incrementally on curated subsets of data ordered by increasing complexity, allowing for faster and more robust learning.

This opens up the possibility to do a lot of interesting tasks like photo-enhancement, image colorization, style transfer, season translation, object transfiguration, and generating photos from paintings, etc. Traditionally, training an image-to-image translation model requires a dataset comprised of paired examples. That is, a large dataset of many examples of input images X (e.g. summer landscapes) and the same image with the desired modification that can be used as an expected output image Y (e.g. winter landscapes). The requirement for a paired training dataset is a limitation. These datasets are challenging and expensive to prepare, e.g. photos of different scenes under different conditions. In many cases, the datasets simply do not exist, such as famous paintings and their respective photographs. As such, there is a desire for techniques for training an image-to-image translation system that does not require paired examples. Specifically, where any two collections of unrelated images can be used and the general characteristics extracted from each collection and used in the image translation process. For example, to be able to take a large collection of photos of summer landscapes and a large collection of photos of winter landscapes with unrelated scenes and locations as the first location and be able to translate specific photos from one group to the other. This is called the problem of unpaired image-to-image translation.</p> <p></p> <p>At first glance, the architecture of the CycleGAN appears complex. Let\u2019s take a moment to step through all of the models involved and their inputs and outputs. Consider the problem where we are interested in translating images from summer to winter and winter to summer. We have two collections of photographs and they are unpaired, meaning they are photos of different locations at different times; we don\u2019t have the exact same scenes in winter and summer.</p> <ul> <li>Collection 1: Photos of summer landscapes.</li> <li>Collection 2: Photos of winter landscapes.</li> </ul> <p>We will develop an architecture of two GANs, and each GAN has a discriminator and a generator model, meaning there are four models in total in the architecture. The first GAN will generate photos of winter given photos of summer, and the second GAN will generate photos of summer given photos of winter.</p> <ul> <li>GAN 1: Translates photos of summer (collection 1) to winter (collection 2).</li> <li>GAN 2: Translates photos of winter (collection 2) to summer (collection 1).</li> </ul> <p>Each GAN has a conditional generator model that will synthesize an image given an input image. And each GAN has a discriminator model to predict how likely the generated image is to have come from the target image collection. The discriminator and generator models for a GAN are trained under normal adversarial loss like a standard GAN model. We can summarize the generator and discriminator models from GAN 1 as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Generator Model 1:</li> <li>Input: Takes photos of summer (collection 1).</li> <li>Output: Generates photos of winter (collection 2).</li> <li>Discriminator Model 1:</li> <li>Input: Takes photos of winter from collection 2 and output from Generator Model 1.</li> <li>Output: Likelihood of image is from collection 2.</li> </ul> <p>So far, the models are sufficient for generating plausible images in the target domain but are not translations of the input image.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Beware:</p> <ul> <li>input can be an image of frequencies that represent a voice and therefore can be used to change your voice!</li> </ul> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-cyclegan/</li> </ul> <p>See also C, [Generative Adversarial Network], [Spectrogram Image]</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/","title":"D","text":""},{"location":"glossary/d/#dall-e-model-family","title":"DALL-E Model Family","text":"<p>A play on words between WALL-E and Dali!</p> <p>More at :</p> <ul> <li>DALL-E 2<ul> <li>open-ai announcement - https://openai.com/dall-e-2/</li> <li>site + paper - https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/</li> <li>how does DALL-E work? - https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-dall-e-2-actually-works/</li> <li>DALL-E 2 uses CLIP - https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06125</li> </ul> </li> <li>DALL-E 3<ul> <li>site - https://openai.com/dall-e-3</li> <li>site - https://openai.com/research/dall-e-3-system-card</li> <li>paper - https://cdn.openai.com/papers/dall-e-3.pdf</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also D, CLIP Model, GLIDE Model</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/#dario-amodei-person","title":"Dario Amodei Person","text":"<p>~ CEO of Anthropic</p> <p>See also D, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/#darpa","title":"DARPA","text":"<ul> <li>2004 - 2005: DARPA Grand Challenge</li> <li>[DARPA Siri]</li> <li>2007: DARPA Urban Challenge</li> <li>2015: DARPA Robotics Challenge</li> <li>2021: DARPA Subterranean Challenge</li> </ul> <p>See also D, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/#darpa-robotics-challenge","title":"DARPA Robotics Challenge","text":"<p>2015 Challenge</p> <p>See also D, AI Challenge</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/#darpa-grand-challenge","title":"DARPA Grand Challenge","text":"<p>2004 and 2005 Driverless car competition.

The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.</p> <p>The opening paragraph echoes unbounded optimism of humans and a lesson of the complexity involved.

The core idea is to predict latent representations of the full input data based on a masked view of the input in a self-distillation setup using a standard Transformer architecture. Instead of predicting modality-specific targets such as words, visual tokens or units of human speech which are local in nature, data2vec predicts contextualized latent representations that contain information from the entire input. Experiments on the major benchmarks of speech recognition, image classification, and natural language understanding demonstrate a new state of the art or competitive performance to predominant approaches.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03555</li> </ul> <p>See also D, Self-Supervised Learning</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/#dataset","title":"Dataset","text":"<p>A group of several observations.

An error (or errors) in the data a computer system uses that results in inaccurate, misleading, or unfair results.</p> <p>Dataset bias, also known as data bias, refers to the presence of systematic and unfair inaccuracies or imbalances in a dataset used for machine learning, statistical analysis, or data-driven decision-making. Dataset bias can result in models or algorithms that make inaccurate predictions or exhibit unfair behavior because the training data does not accurately represent the real-world population or scenario they are meant to address.</p> <p>Dataset bias can manifest in various ways:</p> <ul> <li>Underrepresentation: Underrepresentation occurs when certain categories or groups within the dataset are inadequately represented. For example, if you're training a facial recognition algorithm, and the dataset contains a disproportionate number of images of people with light skin compared to people with dark skin, the algorithm may perform poorly on the latter group.</li> <li>Sampling Bias: Sampling bias arises when the data collection process is not random or the sample selection is flawed. For example, if a political poll is conducted by calling only landline numbers, it may not accurately represent the broader population, leading to sampling bias.</li> <li>Labeling Bias: Labeling bias occurs when the labels or annotations in the dataset are influenced by human biases or errors. For instance, in a text classification dataset, if the annotators have political biases that affect their labeling, the resulting model may inherit those biases.</li> <li>Historical Bias: This type of bias is present when the dataset reflects past practices and biases. For example, in criminal justice, historical bias may exist in arrest and sentencing data, which can lead to models that unfairly target or discriminate against certain demographics.</li> <li>Measurement Bias: Measurement bias results from errors or inaccuracies in the data collection process or measurement instruments. For instance, in climate data, a miscalibrated temperature sensor can introduce measurement bias.</li> <li>Survivorship bias</li> <li>Cognitive bias = anchoring effect + confirmation bias + framing effect + ...</li> </ul> <p>Addressing dataset bias is essential to develop models and algorithms that are fair, accurate, and representative of the real-world scenarios they are meant to handle. To mitigate dataset bias, data scientists and machine learning practitioners should:</p> <ul> <li>Carefully curate and preprocess datasets, paying attention to potential sources of bias.</li> <li>Collect diverse and representative data, and use techniques like oversampling to address underrepresented groups.</li> <li>Implement fairness-aware machine learning methods to ensure that models do not exhibit discriminatory behavior.</li> <li>Be transparent about the limitations and potential biases of the dataset when using machine learning for decision-making.</li> </ul> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://prabhakarkrishnamurthy.substack.com/p/understanding-data-bias</li> <li>https://medium.com/@nahmed3536/data-bias-what-all-data-practitioners-should-be-aware-of-115eaeae48c</li> <li>examples:<ul> <li>https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/hidden-bias/</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also D, Artefact</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/#dataset-size-efficient-frontier","title":"Dataset Size Efficient Frontier","text":"<p>One of the 3 Neural Scaling Laws</p> <p>See also D, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/#david-luan-person","title":"David Luan Person","text":"<p>CEO of Adept AI</p> <p>See also D, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/#dawid-skene-algorithm","title":"Dawid-Skene Algorithm","text":"<p>When you crowdsource a labeling task, how can you be certain that the label is correct?

Two main difficulties are identified: 1) executing plans in an open-world environment (e.g., Minecraft) necessitates accurate and multi-step reasoning due to the long-term nature of tasks, and 2) as vanilla planners do not consider how easy the current agent can achieve a given sub-task when ordering parallel sub-goals within a complicated plan, the resulting plan could be inefficient or even infeasible. To this end, we propose \"D\u23af\u23af\u23afescribe, E\u23af\u23af\u23afxplain, P\u23af\u23af\u23aflan and S\u23af\u23afelect\" (DEPS), an interactive planning approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs).

Furthermore, it includes a goal selector, which is a trainable module that ranks parallel candidate sub-goals based on the estimated steps of completion, consequently refining the initial plan.

Dimensionality reduction is the process of discovering the features that account for the greatest changes in the response variable. Dimensionality reduction can also be used to visualize data. It is easy to visualize a regression problem such as predicting the price of a home from its size; the size of the home can be plotted on the graph's x axis, and the price of the home can be plotted on the y axis. It is similarly easy to visualize the housing price regression problem when a second feature is added; the number of bathrooms in the house could be plotted on the z axis, for instance.

Or when testing microchips within the manufacturing process, you might have thousands of measurements and tests applied to every chip, many of which provide redundant information.

Solution: The discriminator gets a probability score after convolutions and hence the discriminator chooses the decision based on the probability.  The goal of the discriminator is to provide feedback to the generator about how realistic the generated outputs (e.g. piano rolls) are, so that the generator can learn to produce more realistic data. The discriminator provides this feedback by outputting a scalar value that represents how \u201creal\u201d or \u201cfake\u201d a piano roll is.

While diffusion models have been successfully applied for image editing, very few works have done so for video editing. We present the first diffusion-based method that is able to perform text-based motion and appearance editing of general videos. Our approach uses a video diffusion model to combine, at inference time, the low-resolution spatio-temporal information from the original video with new, high resolution information that it synthesized to align with the guiding text-prompt. As obtaining high-fidelity to the original video requires retaining some of its high-resolution information, we add a preliminary stage of finetuning the model on the original video, significantly boosting fidelity. We propose to improve motion editability by a new, mixed objective that jointly finetunes with full temporal attention and with temporal attention masking. We further introduce a new framework for image animation. We first transform the image into a coarse video by simple image processing operations such as replication and perspective geometric projections, and then use our general video editor to animate it. As a further application, we can use our method for subject-driven video generation. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments showcase the remarkable editing ability of our method and establish its superior performance compared to baseline methods.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>site - [https://dreamix-video-editing.github.io/]](https://dreamix-video-editing.github.io/)</li> <li>paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01329</li> </ul> <p>See also D, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/d/#dropout","title":"Dropout","text":"<p>~ Used for regulation to prevent overfitting</p> <p>~ Like pruning?

Both using too few or too many epochs can lead to problems:</p> <p>Too Few Epochs:</p> <ul> <li>Underfitting: With too few epochs, the model does not have enough opportunities to learn from the training data. This can lead to underfitting, where the model fails to capture important patterns in the data.</li> <li>Suboptimal metrics: Validation metrics like accuracy and loss will be worse than their optimum if training is stopped too early.

Exploration involves trying new actions randomly, while exploitation is taking the best known action based on past experience.</li> <li>The exploration rate (epsilon) determines the probability that the agent will take a random exploratory action instead of the best exploitative action at any given time step.</li> <li>Typically, epsilon starts closer to 1 early in training to encourage more random exploration. It is then decayed towards 0 as training progresses to focus more on exploitation.</li> <li>Higher epsilon values force the agent to explore more. Lower epsilon values make it exploit learned knowledge more.</li> <li>Setting the initial epsilon value and decay rate allows controlling this tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Faster decay can be used for simpler environments.</li> <li>Common decay functions include linear decay, exponential decay, or inverse sigmoid decay. The schedule can be based on number of timesteps or episodes.</li> <li>Too little exploration can lead to the agent getting stuck in suboptimal policies. Too much exploration becomes inefficient if random actions are taken when better ones are known.</li> <li>The optimal exploration rate schedule is environment-specific and must be tuned through multiple training iterations.

Speed up GPU processing by using tiling and recomputation to reduce GPU memory IOs.</p> <p>[Transformers] are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate self-attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU High Bandwidth Memory (GPU-HBM) and [GPU on-chip SRAM (GPU-SRAM]. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains [Transformers] faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3\u00d7 speedup on [GPT-2] (seq. length 1K), and 2.4\u00d7 speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K).

Fusing these operations means combining them into a single operation that performs all the required computations simultaneously, reducing the need for intermediate storage and data transfer between different kernel launches.</p> <p>By fusing kernels, the computational efficiency can be improved in several ways:</p> <p>Reduced memory overhead: Fusing kernels eliminates the need to store intermediate results in memory, resulting in lower memory usage. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large tensors or when memory resources are limited.</p> <p>Minimized data movement: Fused kernels perform multiple operations on the same data without the need for transferring data between different kernel launches. This reduces the data movement overhead, improving performance.</p> <p>Enhanced hardware utilization: Fusing kernels allows for better utilization of hardware resources, such as GPU cores. By executing multiple operations in a single kernel, the GPU cores can be fully utilized, leading to improved parallelism and faster computation.</p> <p>Fused kernels are commonly used in deep learning frameworks and libraries to optimize the execution of neural network models. They are implemented through specialized libraries or compiler optimizations that identify opportunities for fusion and generate efficient code that combines multiple operations into a single kernel. The specific techniques and mechanisms for kernel fusion may vary depending on the deep learning framework or library being used.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://www.surfactants.net/creating-a-fused-kernel-in-pytorch/</li> <li>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56601075/what-is-a-fused-kernel-or-fused-layer-in-deep-learning</li> <li>https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-increase-training-performance-through-memory-optimization-1000d30351c8</li> </ul> <p>See also F, Activation Checkpointing, GPU, [Zero Redundancy Optimization]</p>"},{"location":"glossary/f/#futuri-media-company","title":"Futuri Media Company","text":"<p>Find out how we help you grow your content, audience, and revenue.</p> <p>Products:</p> <ul> <li>RadioGPT</li> <li>TopicPulse: Story analysis to see the real-time time evolution of a topic</li> <li>FuturiStreaming: Get stats on streams, number of listener, etc</li> </ul> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://futurimedia.com/</li> </ul> <p>See also F, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/g/","title":"G","text":""},{"location":"glossary/g/#galactica-llm","title":"Galactica LLM","text":"<p>Galactica is \u201ca large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge,\u201d according to a paper published by Meta AI.

Motion sensors in a device can track and interpret gestures, using them as the primary source of data input. A majority of gesture recognition solutions feature a combination of 3D depth-sensing cameras and infrared cameras together with machine learning systems. Machine learning algorithms are trained based on labeled depth images of hands, allowing them to recognize hand and finger positions.</p> <p>Gesture recognition consists of three basic levels:   * Detection. With the help of a camera, a device detects hand or body movements, and a machine learning algorithm segments the image to find hand edges and positions.   * Tracking. A device monitors movements frame by frame to capture every movement and provide accurate input for data analysis.   * Recognition. The system tries to find patterns based on the gathered data. When the system finds a match and interprets a gesture, it performs the action associated with this gesture. Feature extraction and classification in the scheme below implements the recognition functionality.</p> <p></p> <p>Many solutions use vision-based systems for hand tracking, but such an approach has a lot of limitations. Users have to move their hands within a restricted area, and these systems struggle when hands overlap or aren\u2019t fully visible. With sensor-based motion tracking, however, gesture recognition systems are capable of recognizing both static and dynamic gestures in real time.</p> <p>In sensor-based systems, depth sensors are used to align computer-generated images with real ones. Leap motion sensors are also used in hand tracking to detect the number and three-dimensional position of fingers, locate the center of the palm, and determine hand orientation. Processed data provides insights on fingertip angles, distance from the palm center, fingertip elevation, coordinates in 3D space, and more. The hand gesture recognition system using image processing looks for patterns using algorithms trained on data from depth and leap motion sensors:   1. The system distinguishes a hand from the background using color and depth data. The hand sample is further divided into the arm, wrist, palm, and fingers. The system ignores the arm and wrist since they don\u2019t provide gesture information.   1. Next, the system obtains information about the distance from the fingertips to the center of the palm, the elevation of the fingertips, the shape of the palm, the position of the fingers, and so on.   1. Lastly, the system collects all extracted features into a feature vector that represents a gesture. A hand gesture recognition solution, using AI, matches the feature vector with various gestures in the database and recognizes the user\u2019s gesture.</p> <p>Depth sensors are crucial for hand tracking technology since they allow users to put aside specialized wearables like gloves and make HCI more natural.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://intellias.com/hand-tracking-and-gesture-recognition-using-ai-applications-and-challenges/</li> </ul> <p>See also H, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/h/#hand-tracking","title":"Hand Tracking","text":"<p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/on-device-real-time-hand-tracking-with.html</li> </ul> <p>See also H, [Hand Gesture Recognition]</p>"},{"location":"glossary/h/#hanson-robotics-company","title":"Hanson Robotics Company","text":"<p>Hanson Robotics Limited is a Hong Kong-based engineering and robotics company founded by David Hanson, known for its development of human-like robots with artificial intelligence (AI) for consumer, entertainment, service, healthcare, and research applications.

While heuristics can reduce the burden of decision-making and free up limited cognitive resources, they can also be costly when they lead individuals to miss critical information or act on unjust biases.</p> <p>The study of heuristics was developed by renowned psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Starting in the 1970s, Kahneman and Tversky identified several different kinds of heuristics, most notably the availability heuristic and the anchoring heuristic. Since then, researchers have continued their work and identified many different kinds of heuristics, including:</p> <ul> <li>Familiarity heuristic</li> <li>Fundamental attribution error</li> <li>Representativeness heuristic</li> <li>Satisficing</li> </ul> <pre><code>What is the anchoring heuristic?\nThe anchoring heuristic, or anchoring bias, occurs when someone relies more heavily on the first piece of information learned when making a choice, even if it's not the most relevant. In such cases, anchoring is likely to steer individuals wrong.\n\nWhat is the availability heuristic?\nThe availability heuristic describes the mental shortcut in which someone estimates whether something is likely to occur based on how readily examples come to mind. People tend to overestimate the probability of plane crashes, homicides, and shark attacks, for instance, because examples of such events are easily remembered.\n\nWhat is the representativeness heuristic?\nPeople who make use of the representativeness heuristic categorize objects (or other people) based on how similar they are to known entities\u2014assuming someone described as \"quiet\" is more likely to be a librarian than a politician, for instance.\n\nWhat is satisficing?\nSatisficing is a decision-making strategy in which the first option that satisfies certain criteria is selected, even if other, better options may exist.\n\nWhat is the fundamental attribution error?\nSometimes called the attribution effect or correspondence bias, the term describes a tendency to attribute others\u2019 behavior primarily to internal factors\u2014like personality or character\u2014while attributing one\u2019s own behavior more to external or situational factors.\n</code></pre> <p>When are heuristic wrong?</p> <pre><code>What is an example of the fundamental attribution error?\nIf one person steps on the foot of another in a crowded elevator, the victim may attribute it to carelessness.

Out of all that data, 25% of the expected values are 5 while the other 75% are 10.

Any decision the algorithm author can't make for you. In machine learning, we use the term hyperparameter to distinguish from standard model parameters. So, it is worth to first understand what those are. A machine learning model is the definition of a mathematical formula with a number of parameters that need to be learned from the data. That is the crux of machine learning: fitting a model to the data. This is done through a process known as model training. In other words, by training a model with existing data, we are able to fit the model parameters. <code>However, there is another kind of parameters that cannot be directly learned from the regular training process</code>. These parameters express \u201chigher-level\u201d properties of the model such as its complexity or how fast it should learn. They are called hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are usually fixed before the actual training process begins. So, how are hyperparameters decided? That is probably beyond the scope of this question, but suffice to say that, broadly speaking, this is done by setting different values for those hyperparameters, training different models, and deciding which ones work best by testing them.</p> <p>So, to summarize. Hyperparameters:</p> <ul> <li>Define higher level concepts about the model such as complexity, or capacity to learn.</li> <li>Cannot be learned directly from the data in the standard model training process and need to be predefined.</li> <li>Can be decided by setting different values, training different models, and choosing the values that test better</li> </ul> <p>Some examples of hyperparameters:</p> <ul> <li>Number of leaves or depth of a tree</li> <li>Number of trees</li> <li>Number of latent factors in a matrix factorization</li> <li>Learning rate (in many models)</li> <li>Number of hidden layers in a deep neural network</li> <li>Number of hidden nodes in network layers</li> <li>Number of clusters in a k-means clustering</li> <li>[Drop out function]</li> <li>Regularization</li> <li>Boosting step size</li> <li>Initialization of clustering algorithm</li> </ul> <p>Beware often you have 1 hyperparameter that is more impactful than the other.

Yes, in a real or latent dimension! For example in a 3D space, a 2-D plane could be an hyperplane where on one side you have the elements of class A and on the other side you have the elements of class B. Used as a decision boundary. A hyperplane is a subspace that has one dimension less than the ambient space that contains it. In simple linear regression, there is one dimension for the response variable and another dimension for the explanatory variable, for a total of two dimensions. The regression hyperplane thus has one dimension; a hyperplane with one dimension is a line. In mathematics, a hyperplane H is a linear subspace of a vector space V such that the basis of H has cardinality one less than the cardinality of the basis for V.  In other words, if V is an n-dimensional vector space than H is an (n-1)-dimensional subspace.  Examples of hyperplanes in 2 dimensions are any straight line through the origin. In 3 dimensions, any plane containing the origin.  In higher dimensions, it is useful to think of a hyperplane as member of an affine family of (n-1)-dimensional subspaces (affine spaces look and behavior very similar to linear spaces but they are not required to contain the origin), such that the entire space is partitioned into these affine subspaces. This family will be stacked along the unique vector (up to sign) that is perpendicular to the original hyperplane.

ImageNet is an image dataset organized according to the WordNet hierarchy. Each meaningful concept in WordNet, possibly described by multiple words or word phrases, is called a \"synonym set\" or \"synset\". There are more than 100,000 synsets in WordNet; the majority of them are nouns (80,000+). In ImageNet, we aim to provide on average 1000 images to illustrate each synset. Images of each concept are quality-controlled and human-annotated. In its completion, we hope ImageNet will offer tens of millions of cleanly labeled and sorted images for most of the concepts in the WordNet hierarchy. The ImageNet project was inspired by two important needs in computer vision research. The first was the need to establish a clear North Star problem in computer vision. While the field enjoyed an abundance of important tasks to work on, from stereo vision to image retrieval, from 3D reconstruction to image segmentation, object categorization was recognized to be one of the most fundamental capabilities of both human and machine vision. Hence there was a growing demand for a high quality object categorization benchmark with clearly established evaluation metrics. Second, there was a critical need for more data to enable more generalizable machine learning methods. Ever since the birth of the digital era and the availability of web-scale data exchanges, researchers in these fields have been working hard to design more and more sophisticated algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and annotate multimedia data. But good research requires good resources. To tackle this problem at scale (think of your growing personal collection of digital images, or videos, or a commercial web search engine\u2019s database), it was critical to provide researchers with a large-scale image database for both training and testing.

A precursor of the ChatGPT model. Large language models like GPT-3 are often used to follow instructions to execute user\u2019s tasks. However, quite often, these models generate toxic or untruthful outputs that are not related to the input instructions. This is mostly due to the fact that models like GPT-3 are trained to predict the next word in a sentence rather than to execute a specific task. This is precisesly the problem OpenAI tried to address with InstructGPT, a language model that builds upon GPT-3 language capabilities but improves it its ability to follow instructions.</p> <p>The InstructGPT is build in three steps.</p> <ol> <li>The first step fine-tunes pretrained GPT-3 using 13k dataset. This dataset is from two sources:<ol> <li>The team hired human labelers, who were asked to write and answer prompts \u2014 think NLP tasks. For example the human labeler was tasked to create an instruction and then multiple query &amp; response pairs for it.</li> <li>The prompts by the end users in the Open.ai API, Playground. These prompts included various NLP tasks \u2014 text generation, Q&amp;A, summarization etc.    Supervised learning is used for the fine-tuning of the pretrained GPT-3. The dataset includes both inputs, but as well corresponding human labeled output.</li> </ol> </li> <li>The second step and third step rely on reinforcement learning. Let\u2019s first review the second step \u2014 the reward model.<ul> <li>The reward model is trained with 50k additional prompts. Prompt and multiple model outputs are generated. Model outputs are ranked by human from best to worse. The reward model is then trained to predict the human preferred output.</li> <li>The third step is to optimize the policy using the reward model with 31k dataset. The data is purely from the Playground tool without any labeler written prompts. Therefore it differs from the first two steps.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>A prompt is generated. An output is generated by the policy. Reward is given for the output based on the reward model. The achieved reward is then used to optimize the policy using PPO algorithm.</p> <p></p> <p>There is a difference between the way the GPT-3 and the InstructGPT generate outputs. GPT-3 was designed to predict next token. This is important to keep in mind. Despite GPT-3 is able to predict the next word \u2014 the output could be unhelpful. Think for example toxic speech in end-user application. The misalignment refers in NLP \u2014 to the issue of outputs not matching user\u2019s intent. <code>The InstructGPT is fine-tuned to human preference using reinforcement learning</code>.

Note that the processing of the entire dataset, called an epoch, may require several iterations. This is particularly the case in the case of a large / very-large dataset.</p> <p>In DeepRacer, an iteration refers to one full pass through the training data to update the reinforcement learning (policy) model. Each iteration consists of multiple episodes (1 episode = car crash or complite an entire track) :</p> <ul> <li>One iteration involves running a specified number of episodes on the track.</li> <li>For example, 10 episodes per iteration.</li> <li>During each episode, the agent races around the track, gathering experience about taking actions in different states.</li> <li>After completing the specified number of episodes, the reinforcement learning (policy) model is updated once based on the experience gathered.</li> <li>This completes one full iteration. The episodes are reset and the process repeats for the next iteration.</li> <li>Multiple iterations are run consecutively to train the (policy) model over time with more and more experience from the track.</li> <li>The number of episodes per iteration and number of total iterations are key hyperparameters to configure the training.</li> <li>More episodes per iteration gather more diverse experience for each update but reduce update frequency.</li> <li>Running many iterations is needed for the agent to converge to a good policy. Hundreds of iterations are common.</li> </ul> <p>So in summary, one iteration involves multiple episodes followed by one model update. Multiple iterations drive the learning process over time to optimize the policy.</p> <p>The concepts of iteration and epoch are sometimes used interchangeably, but they have some subtle differences in the context of reinforcement learning:</p> <p>Iteration:</p> <ul> <li>In reinforcement learning, one iteration typically refers to running through a batch of experience data and updating the model once.</li> <li>For example, Running 10 episodes to generate new experience data, then using that to improve the policy once.</li> </ul> <p>Epoch:</p> <ul> <li>Epoch usually refers to the number of complete passes through the full dataset to train the model.</li> <li>For example, setting epoch=5 would mean passing through ALL available experience data 5 times, updating the model each time.</li> </ul> <p>So the key differences are:</p> <ul> <li>Iteration - Single update based on a batch of new experience (episodes).</li> <li>Epoch - Full pass through all past experience with multiple updates.</li> <li>Iterations happen sequentially, gathering new data over time.</li> <li>Epochs reuse the same dataset multiple times.</li> <li>In DeepRacer, iterations happen continuously as the car gathers more experience. Epochs are less common.</li> </ul> <p>So in reinforcement learning, iterations drive learning over time from new experience, while epochs reuse experience for regularization. But the terms are sometimes conflated.</p> <p>Here is a concrete example to illustrate the differences between epoch and iteration:</p> <p>Let's say we are training a DeepRacer model. We configure the following:</p> <ul> <li>Episodes per iteration: 10</li> <li>Iterations: 100</li> <li>Epochs: 5</li> </ul> <p>This means:</p> <ul> <li>During each iteration, the agent will run 10 episode races to generate experience data.</li> <li>There will be 100 iterations, so 100 batches of 10 episodes.</li> <li>1000 total episodes (10 * 100).</li> <li>The experience from each iteration's episodes will be used to update the model weights once.</li> <li>After the 100 iterations complete, representing gathering new experience over time, we will then run 5 epochs.</li> <li>For each epoch, the agent will replay through ALL past 1000 episodes to further train the model.</li> </ul> <p>So:</p> <ul> <li>Iterations = New data gathered over time, single update per batch.</li> <li>Epochs = Multiple passes over full past data for further training.</li> </ul> <p>This example highlights how iterations drive sequential learning, while epochs refine training on existing experience. The terms have distinct meanings in reinforcement learning.</p> <p>There are a few key reasons why having both the notion of iterations and epochs can be useful in reinforcement learning:</p> <ul> <li>Iterations allow for sequential learning - New data is gathered over time through agent-environment interaction, and the policy is updated incrementally. This is crucial for online RL.</li> <li>Epochs complement this by allowing offline refinement on past experience. The policy can be smoothed and regularized by replaying old episodes.</li> <li>In the early stages of training, iterations quickly evolve the policy using fresh data. Epochs are less critical.</li> <li>But epochs become more useful later. As sample efficiency increases, replay and reuse of past experience is helpful.</li> <li>Epochs also help deal with correlated sequential experience. Random reshuffling during epoch replays helps de-correlate the data.</li> <li>Multiple epochs can expose the model to a wider variety of transitions rather than just recent frequent ones.</li> <li>Too many epochs can however lead to overfitting. The balance with iterations should be tuned.</li> <li>For continuous training, iterations naturally align with expanding the dataset over time.</li> </ul> <p>So in essence, iterations drive continuous learning while epochs refine and generalize the behavior through experience replay.

Let\u2019s say we have two hyperparameters each having three different values. So, we have 9 (3 x 3) different combinations of hyperparameter values. The space in which all those combinations contain is called the hyperparameter space. When there are two hyperparameters, space is two dimensional.</p> <p>In grid search, the algorithm takes one combination of hyperparameter values at a time from the hyperparameter space that we have specified. Then it trains the model using those hyperparameter values and evaluates it through k-fold cross-validation. It stores the performance estimate (e.g. MSE). Then the algorithm takes another combination of hyperparameter values and does the same. After taking all the combinations, the algorithm stores all the performance estimates. Out of those estimates, it selects the best one. The combination of hyperparameter values that yields the best performance estimate is the optimal combination of hyperparameter values. The best model includes those hyperparameter values.</p> <p></p> <p>The reason behind fitting the best model to the whole training set after k-fold cross-validation is to provide more training samples to the learning algorithm of the best model.

Anything can act as a node, for example, people, company, computer, etc. An edge label captures the relationship of interest between the nodes, for example, a friendship relationship between two people, a customer relationship between a company and person, or a network connection between two computers, etc. The directed labeled graph representation is used in a variety of ways depending on the needs of an application. A directed labeled graph such as the one in which the nodes are people, and the edges capture the parent relationship is also known as a data graph. A directed labeled graph in which the nodes are classes of objects (e.g., Book, Textbook, etc.), and the edges capture the subclass relationship, is also known as a taxonomy. In some data models, given a triple (A,B,C), we refer to A, B, C as the subject, the predicate, and the object of the triple respectively. A knowledge graph serves as a data structure in which an application stores information. The information could be added to the knowledge graph through a combination of human input, automated and semi-automated methods. Regardless of the method of knowledge entry, it is expected that the recorded information can be easily understood and verified by humans. Many interesting computations over a graph can be reduced to navigating it. For example, in a friendship KG, to calculate the friends of friends of a person A, we can navigate the graph from A to all nodes B connected to it by a relation labeled as friend, and then recursively to all nodes C connected by the friend relation to each B.</p> <p>Examples of KGs:</p> <ul> <li>Wikidata</li> <li>...</li> </ul> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>notebooks<ul> <li>https://github.com/togethercomputer/together-cookbook/blob/main/Knowledge_Graphs_with_Structured_Outputs.ipynb</li> </ul> </li> <li>articles<ul> <li>https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/introduction-to-knowledge-graphs/</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also K, [Graph Neural Network]</p>"},{"location":"glossary/k/#knowledge-representation","title":"Knowledge Representation","text":"<p>To store what a computer knows or hears!</p> <p>See also K, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/k/#knowledge-retrieval","title":"Knowledge Retrieval","text":"<p>A solution to the hallucinations of Large Language Model ?</p> <p>Possible thanks to a [Information Retriever] that fronts the model</p> <ul> <li>...</li> <li>Neural Retriever</li> </ul> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://venturebeat.com/ai/whats-next-in-large-language-model-llm-research-heres-whats-coming-down-the-ml-pike/</li> </ul> <p>See also K, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/k/#kolmogorov-arnold-network-kan","title":"Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)","text":"<p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a new type of neural network (NN) which focus on the [Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem] instead of the typical universal approximation theorem found in NNs.

Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56% of all tasks.

Well, about a month before the competition, there was a test game which AlphaGo lost. The researchers from DeepMind ported AlphaGo to Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) and then the computer program was able to win by a wide margin.</p> <p>The realization that computational power was a bottleneck for AI's potential led to the inception of Groq and the creation of the LPU. This realization came to Jonathan Ross who initially began what became TPU project in Google. He started Groq in 2016.</p> <p>The LPU is a special kind of computer brain designed to handle language tasks very quickly. Unlike other computer chips that do many things at once (parallel processing), the LPU works on tasks one after the other (sequential processing), which is perfect for understanding and generating language. Imagine it like a relay race where each runner (chip) passes the baton (data) to the next, making everything run super fast. The LPU is designed to overcome the two LLM bottlenecks: compute density and memory bandwidth.</p> <p>Groq took a novel approach right from the start, focusing on software and compiler development before even thinking about the hardware. They made sure the software could guide how the chips talk to each other, ensuring they work together seamlessly like a team in a factory. This makes the LPU really good at processing language efficiently and at high speed, ideal for AI tasks that involve understanding or creating text.</p> <p>This led to a highly optimized system that not only runs circles around traditional setups in terms of speed but does so with greater cost efficiency and lower energy consumption. This is big news for industries like finance, government, and tech, where quick and accurate data processing is key.</p> <p>Now, don't go tossing out your GPUs just yet! While the LPU is a beast when it comes to inference, making light work of applying trained models to new data, GPUs still reign supreme in the training arena. The LPU and GPU might become the dynamic duo of AI hardware, each excelling in their respective roles.</p> <p>To better understand architecture, Groq offers two papers: from 2020 (Think Fast: A Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP) for Accelerating Deep Learning Workloads) and 2022 (A So ware-defined Tensor Streaming Multiprocessor for Large-scale Machine Learning).

Samples that are similar in the external world are positioned close to each other in the latent space. To better understand the concept, let\u2019s think about how humans perceive the world. We are able to understand a broad range of topics by encoding each observed event in a compressed representation in our brain. For example, we don\u2019t keep in mind every detail of the appearance of a dog to be able to recognize a dog in the street. As we can see in the illustration below, we keep an internal representation of the general appearance of a dog:</p> <p></p> <p>In a similar way, the latent space tries to provide a compressed understanding of the world to a computer through a spatial representation.  Deep learning has revolutionized many aspects of our life with applications ranging from self-driving cars to predicting serious diseases. Its main goal is to transform the raw data (such as the pixel values of an image) into a suitable internal representation or feature vector from which the learning subsystem, often a classifier, could detect or classify patterns in the input. So, we realize that deep learning and latent space are strongly related concepts since the internal representations of the former constitute the latter. As we can see below, a deep learning model takes as input raw data and outputs discriminative features that lie in a low-dimensional space referred to as latent space. These features are then used to solve various tasks like classification, regression, or reconstruction:</p> <p></p> <p>To better understand the importance of latent space in deep learning, we should think of the following question: Why do we have to encode the raw data in a low-dimensional l atent space before classification, regression, or reconstruction?

A little bit explanation: within-class variance stands for scatter. The smaller this quantity, the lower data points scatter and vice versa. We want to classify classes, of course we have to maximize the distance between each class, that's why maximizing distance between mean vectors. However, we also need to take into account the scatter of data.The greater the within-class variance, the more data points of 2 classes overlap and it culminates in bad result for classification. Now you know why we need to minimize the scatter.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>PCA vs LDA - https://iq.opengenus.org/pca-vs-lda/</li> </ul> <p>See also L, Dimensionality Reduction, Retrieval Model</p>"},{"location":"glossary/l/#linear-programming","title":"Linear Programming","text":"<p>See also L, Objective Function</p>"},{"location":"glossary/l/#linear-regression","title":"Linear Regression","text":"<p>Find an equation.

The components involved in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a decision maker called an agent that interacts with the environment it is placed in. These interactions occur sequentially overtime. In each timestamp, the agent will get some representation of the environment state. Given this representation, the agent selects an action to make. The environment is then transitioned into some new state and the agent is given a reward as a consequence of its previous action. The process of selecting an action from a given state, transitioning to a new state and receiving a reward happens sequentially over and over again. This creates something called a trajectory that shows the sequence of states, actions and rewards. Throughout the process, it is the responsibility of the reinforcement learning agent to maximize the total amount of rewards that it received from taking actions in given states of environments. <code>The agent not only wants to maximize the immediate rewards but the [cumulative reward] it receives in the whole process.</code></p> <p>More at :</p> <ul> <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process</li> </ul> <p>See also M, Reinforcement Learning, State Model</p>"},{"location":"glossary/m/#markov-random-field","title":"Markov Random Field","text":"<p>See also M, Generative Classifier</p>"},{"location":"glossary/m/#masked-language-modeling-mlm","title":"Masked Language Modeling (MLM)","text":"<p>Methods: replace 15% of words in corpus with special [MASK] token and ask the NLP model (e.g. BERT) to fill in the blank</p> <pre><code>Istanbul is a great [MASK] to visit          # Must guess the word, i.e. city\n</code></pre> <p>Words are broken into tokens, so whole word masking implies that related tokens need to be masked together</p> <pre><code>Input Text             : the man jumped up , put his basket on phil ##am ##mon ' s head\nOriginal Masked Input  : [MASK] man [MASK] up , put his [MASK] on phil [MASK] ##mon ' s head\nWhole Word Masked Input: the man [MASK] up , put his basket on [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] ' s head\n\nThe training is identical -- we still predict each masked WordPiece token independently.

The test covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability. We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest [GPT-3 model] improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.</p> <pre><code>One of the reasons that the government discourages and regulates monopolies is that\n(A) producer surplus is lost and consumer surplus is gained.\n(B) monopoly prices ensure productive efficiency but cost society allocative efficiency.\n(C) monopoly firms do not engage in significant research and development.\n(D) consumer surplus is lost with higher prices and lower levels of output.\n\nWhen you drop a ball from rest it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s\u00b2.

To calculate the MAE, you take the difference between your model\u2019s predictions and the ground truth, apply the absolute value to that difference, and then average it out across the whole dataset. The MAE, like the Mean Square Error (MSE), will never be negative since in this case we are always taking the absolute value of the errors. The MAE is formally defined by the following equation:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <pre><code>## MAE loss function\ndef mae_loss(y_pred, y_true):\n    abs_error = np.abs(y_pred - y_true)\n    sum_abs_error = np.sum(abs_error)\n    loss = sum_abs_error / y_true.size\n    return loss\n</code></pre> <p>Pros and Cons:</p> <ul> <li>Advantage: The beauty of the MAE is that its advantage directly covers the MSE disadvantage.

This can perform significantly better than true stochastic gradient descent because the code can make use of vectorization libraries rather than computing each step separately.

While model merging has emerged as a promising approach for LLM development due to its cost-effectiveness, it currently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its potential. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. Our approach operates in both [parameter space] and [data flow space], allowing for optimization beyond just the weights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates cross-domain merging, generating models like a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese Math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing models with significantly more parameters, despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally-aware Japanese VLM generated through our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese VLMs. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source community, but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation model development.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13187</li> </ul> <p>See also M, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/m/#model-performance-metric","title":"Model Performance Metric","text":"<p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>accuracy or percentage of correct predictions</li> <li>sensitivity, recall, hit rate or TPR</li> <li>precision</li> <li>F1 score = weigthed harmonic mean of precision and recall = ( 2 X precision * recall ) / (Precision + recall)</li> <li>FPR, FNR</li> </ul> <p>Hyperparameter Tuning</p> <p>See also M, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/m/#model-predictive-control-mpc-algorithm","title":"Model Predictive Control (MPC) Algorithm","text":"<p>Used in Look-Ahead Planning ?</p> <p>See also M, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/m/#model-release-card","title":"Model Release Card","text":"<p>~ What is released and how for a given model.</p> <p>Includes:</p> <ul> <li>overall position on safety-transparency scale</li> <li>datasets</li> <li>code</li> <li>(trained) model</li> <li>model card</li> <li>responsible use guide</li> <li>notebook</li> <li>research paper</li> <li>demo/samples</li> </ul> <p>all of whom can be:</p> <ul> <li>not released</li> <li>gated release for researchers</li> <li>released</li> <li>available for non-commercial use</li> </ul> <p>A team should assume that the project will be entirely open-sourced even so that may not be the case due to [responsible AI]</p> <p>Below is the example for the LLaMa Model</p> <p></p> <p>See also M, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/m/#model-release-frontier","title":"Model Release Frontier","text":"<p>A ... approach to conceptually mapping trade-offs of model releases is a frontier which present trade-offs between 2 dimensions:</p> <ul> <li>knowledge = greater understanding of the capability and limitations of model performance</li> <li>steerability = degree of control to adjust or alter release conditions ex post</li> </ul> <p>The past few years have seen a range of attempts to identify options along the knowledge-steerability frontier.</p> <p>Seeking to balance the benefits of knowledge gains with</p> <ul> <li>accessibility</li> <li>recourse</li> <li>maintenance (of code base)</li> <li>downstream impacts</li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>related paper on staged release - https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09203</li> <li>CivicScape<ul> <li>code - https://github.com/BurgerAutomata/CivicScape/blob/master/README.md</li> <li>open-source the solution? - https://qz.com/938635/a-predictive-policing-startup-released-all-its-code-so-it-can-be-scoured-for-bias</li> <li>mit review - https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/ </li> <li>bloomberg (blocked) - https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-07-10/the-ex-cop-at-the-center-of-controversy-over-crime-prediction-tech</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also M, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/m/#model-risk-management-mrm","title":"Model Risk Management (MRM)","text":"<p>In 2021, real estate marketplace company Zillow took a USD 304 million inventory write-down and planned to slash a quarter of its workforce following its failed home-buying venture, which was partly caused by the inability of its housing price valuation model to accurately predict home prices.</p> <p>Model risk can stem from various causes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data </p> <p>A model\u2019s input data might be erroneous, incomplete, outdated or biased. If outdated data is used for a market model, for instance, then it might project skewed trends regarding market performance or market prices.</p> <p>Also, if training data sets for artificial intelligence (AI) models aren\u2019t evaluated for the presence of bias, these AI models can produce results that reflect and perpetuate the intrinsic bias in the data. For example, job applicant screening systems might favor male or younger applicants, while healthcare prediction software might exhibit racial bias when prioritizing patients in need of immediate care.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assumptions and variables</p> <p>Assumptions might be flawed or unrealistic. Irrelevant, wrong, missed or omitted variables or incorrect variable calibrations can affect model output.</p> <p>For instance, a pricing model that doesn\u2019t factor in market volatility might produce inaccurate estimates, while product demand forecasting models that fail to consider seasonal purchasing behaviors or current economic conditions, such as shipping delays or decreased spending, might lead to poorly managed inventory levels.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a patient care prediction model that puts a greater weight on a variable such as healthcare spending might result in the model discriminating against those who have lower incomes and thus spend less on healthcare but have a greater need to access it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Methodology</p> <p>The chosen methodology might have inherent errors, so model developers need to be knowledgeable about the model and aware of its limitations. For example, statistical methods such as regression modeling can have sampling and standard errors.</p> <p>This is also where selecting the right model comes in. For instance, even though generative AI is the latest technology, it might not be a strong fit for financial forecasting, where other well-established models can do it for less work and lower cost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Model implementation</p> <p>Incomplete or incorrect model development can lead to inaccurate results or model errors.

Applying any shortcuts or simplifications as a result of model uncertainty and complexity might also affect the outcome.</p> <p>For example, tight timelines to deploy a predictive analytics model for sales performance might lead to using real-time data feeds of sales numbers. However, because of this decision, the model might fail frequently or be slow to run. In this case, switching to a daily or weekly data snapshot might improve the model\u2019s speed and stability.</p> <p>Rigorous testing can also help detect errors during implementation, such as accidentally using a different date format for an insurance claims assessment model or another unit of measurement for a healthcare diagnostics model, or inadvertently modifying the currency for a pricing model.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interpretation of results</p> <p>Misinterpreting the output of a model can lead to misinformed decision-making and taking the wrong course of action.

These methods are used to find optimal policies for decision-making problems, particularly in environments where the model (i.e., the complete knowledge of the environment's dynamics) is not known. They rely on the Monte Carlo approach, which involves learning from complete episodes of experience without requiring a model of the environment's dynamics.</p> <p>Key Concepts:</p> <ol> <li>Episodic Tasks: Monte Carlo methods are applied to episodic tasks, where the interaction is broken down into episodes, and each episode eventually ends in a terminal state.</li> <li>Experience Sampling: The agent learns from episodes of experience. Each episode consists of states, actions, and rewards, and the agent's task is to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward.</li> <li>Exploration vs. Exploitation: Monte Carlo control methods must balance exploration (trying new actions to discover their effects) with exploitation (choosing known actions that yield high rewards).</li> </ol> <p>How Monte Carlo Control Works:</p> <ul> <li>Policy Evaluation: The value of each state is estimated based on the average returns (total rewards) received after visiting that state. This is done by sampling episodes and calculating the return for each state-action pair.</li> <li>Policy Improvement: The policy is then improved by choosing actions that lead to higher-value states. This is typically done using a greedy approach, where the action with the highest estimated value is chosen.</li> </ul> <p>Types of Monte Carlo Control Methods:</p> <ul> <li>On-Policy Methods: These methods, like Monte Carlo with Exploring Starts or Monte Carlo On-Policy Control (e.g., \u03b5-greedy policies), improve the policy that is used to make decisions.</li> <li>Off-Policy Methods: These methods, such as Importance Sampling, learn the value of the optimal policy independently of the agent's actions (i.e., they can learn from data generated by a different policy).</li> </ul> <p>Advantages and Challenges:</p> <ul> <li>Model-Free: Monte Carlo methods do not require a model of the environment and learn directly from experience.</li> <li>Simplicity: These methods are conceptually simple and easy to implement.</li> <li>High Variance: Returns can have high variance, which might slow down learning or require many episodes to converge.</li> <li>Episode Dependency: They are only applicable to episodic tasks and require complete episodes to update the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Monte Carlo control methods are particularly useful in situations where the environment is complex or unknown, and the agent must learn entirely from its interaction with the environment.

From one result, you cannot deduce the others from one previous result.</p> <p>Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are particularly useful in three main areas:</p> <ul> <li>Mathematical Integration: Monte Carlo methods are used to approximate the value of integrals, especially when dealing with high-dimensional spaces where traditional integration techniques become infeasible.</li> <li>Optimization: These methods are useful in finding optimal solutions in various fields, such as finance and logistics, where the solution space is large and complex.</li> <li>Simulation: Monte Carlo simulations are widely used in various fields like physics, engineering, finance, and biology to model complex systems and processes. For example, in finance, they are used to model the behavior of markets or to assess risks.</li> </ul> <p>The name \"Monte Carlo\" was coined during the 1940s by scientists working on nuclear weapon projects in the Los Alamos National Laboratory. It refers to the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco since chance and randomness are central to the casino games, much like the methods themselves.</p> <p>Monte Carlo methods are powerful because they allow for the modeling of complex phenomena and systems that are analytically intractable or difficult to model with deterministic methods. However, they typically require a large number of samples to produce accurate results and are computationally intensive.</p> <p>Monte Carlo methods encompass a variety of techniques, each tailored to specific types of problems or simulations. Here are some notable examples:</p> <ul> <li>Simple Monte Carlo Integration: This is used for estimating the value of integrals. It involves randomly sampling points in the domain and averaging the function values at these points.</li> <li>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): These methods, including the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampling, are used for generating samples from a probability distribution. They are particularly useful in Bayesian statistics and machine learning for tasks like parameter estimation and model selection.</li> <li>Monte Carlo Localization: Used in robotics, this method helps in estimating the position of a robot by generating a set of sample points (hypotheses) about its position and updating these points as the robot moves.</li> <li>Bootstrap Methods: These are used for statistical inference. They involve repeatedly resampling a dataset with replacement and calculating a statistic (like the mean) for each sample. This helps in understanding the variability and confidence of the estimate.</li> <li>Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): This method is used in decision processes, notably in AI for board games like Go and chess. It involves building a search tree and using random simulations to estimate the long-term potential of each move.</li> <li>Monte Carlo Ray Tracing: In computer graphics, this method is used for generating photorealistic images by simulating the path of light as pixels in an image plane, producing a very high degree of visual realism.</li> <li>Monte Carlo Methods in Finance: Used for option pricing and risk assessment. These methods simulate various economic scenarios to estimate the price of financial instruments or the risk in investment portfolios.</li> <li>Particle Filters: Used in signal processing and Bayesian inference, these methods involve representing the required probability distribution by a set of random samples (particles) and updating these samples over time.</li> </ul> <p>Each of these methods applies the core principle of Monte Carlo \u2014 using randomness and statistical sampling to solve problems that might be deterministic but are too complex for analytical solutions.</p> <p>See also M, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/m/#monte-carlo-policy-gradient-algorithm","title":"Monte Carlo Policy Gradient Algorithm","text":"<p>See REINFORCE Algorithm</p>"},{"location":"glossary/m/#monte-carlo-tree-search-mcts-algorithm","title":"Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Algorithm","text":"<p>To do Look-Ahead Planning ?</p> <p>Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is an algorithm used to make optimal decisions in artificial intelligence systems, often for game playing.

To address this, we explore using strong [LLMs as judges] (such as [GTP-4]) to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans.

Just by scaling it up we can get a better language model, and a better language model entails a better world model</p> <p>We study empirical scaling laws for language model performance on the [cross-entropy loss]. The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.</p> <p>We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4\u00d7 more more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7% improvement over Gopher.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>2022/03/29 <ul> <li>paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556</li> </ul> </li> <li>2020/10/28<ul> <li>paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14701</li> </ul> </li> <li>2020/01/23<ul> <li>announcement - https://openai.com/index/scaling-laws-for-neural-language-models/</li> <li>paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361</li> </ul> </li> <li>articles<ul> <li>evolution of scaling law for LLM - https://medium.com/@lmpo/the-evolution-of-scaling-laws-for-llms-aeb6ae64f6f1</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also N, Artificial Neural Network, Statistical Model</p>"},{"location":"glossary/n/#neural-style-transfer-nst","title":"Neural Style Transfer (NST)","text":"<p>Use for generating images. * Only 2 images, the base and the style image, with pre-trained VGG. * Perform back-propagation base image pixels, updating transfer style. * 3 loss functions: content, style, total variance.</p>"},{"location":"glossary/n/#neural-topic-modeling-ntm","title":"Neural Topic Modeling (NTM)","text":"<p>An unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to organize a corpus of documents into topics that contain word groupings based on their statistical distribution. Documents that contain frequent occurrences of words such as \"bike\", \"car\", \"train\", \"mileage\", and \"speed\" are likely to share a topic on \"transportation\" for example. Topic modeling can be used to classify or summarize documents based on the topics detected or to retrieve information or recommend content based on topic similarities. The topics from documents that NTM learns are characterized as a latent representation because the topics are inferred from the observed word distributions in the corpus. The semantics of topics are usually inferred by examining the top ranking words they contain. Because the method is unsupervised, only the number of topics, not the topics themselves, are prespecified. In addition, the topics are not guaranteed to align with how a human might naturally categorize documents. // Topic modeling provides a way to visualize the contents of a large document corpus in terms of the learned topics. Documents relevant to each topic might be indexed or searched for based on their soft topic labels. The latent representations of documents might also be used to find similar documents in the topic space. You can also use the latent representations of documents that the topic model learns for input to another supervised algorithm such as a document classifier. Because the latent representations of documents are expected to capture the semantics of the underlying documents, algorithms based in part on these representations are expected to perform better than those based on lexical features alone. // Although you can use both the Amazon SageMaker NTM and LDA algorithms for topic modeling, they are distinct algorithms and can be expected to produce different results on the same input data.</p> <p>See also N, LDA, Unsupervised Learning</p>"},{"location":"glossary/n/#neural-winter","title":"Neural Winter","text":"<p>A period between 1998 and 2007, where research in deep learning dropped off due to limitations on data and compute.

It uses these experiences to update its policy iteratively, typically through methods like policy gradients or temporal difference learning.</p> <p>The key characteristic of on-policy learning is that the data used for updating the policy comes from the current policy's own interactions with the environment. As a result, the policy being learned affects the trajectory of the agent, and any changes to the policy will impact the exploration and exploitation of the environment.</p> <p>One advantage of on-policy learning is that it can effectively handle changing or non-stationary environments since the agent continually interacts with the current environment state.

Nonetheless, the enormous size of LLMs impedes routine deployment. To address the issue, we present Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA), a novel quantization-aware PEFT technique that facilitates model compression and accelerates inference. PEQA operates through a dual-stage process: initially, the parameter matrix of each fully-connected layer undergoes quantization into a matrix of low-bit integers and a scalar vector; subsequently, fine-tuning occurs on the scalar vector for each downstream task. Such a strategy compresses the size of the model considerably, leading to a lower inference latency upon deployment and a reduction in the overall memory required. At the same time, fast fine-tuning and efficient task switching becomes possible. In this way, PEQA offers the benefits of quantization, while inheriting the advantages of PEFT. We compare PEQA with competitive baselines in comprehensive experiments ranging from natural language understanding to generation benchmarks. This is done using large language models of up to 65 billion parameters, demonstrating PEQA's scalability, task-specific adaptation performance, and ability to follow instructions, even in extremely low-bit settings.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>paper - [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14152(https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14152)</li> <li>articles<ul> <li>https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/09/18/what-is-llm-compression/</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also P, QLoRA</p>"},{"location":"glossary/p/#parameter-efficient-fine-tuning-peft","title":"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)","text":"<p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods enable efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters.

Why use? many situations that require low dimensional data including:</p> <ul> <li>data visualisation</li> <li>data storage</li> <li>computation</li> </ul> <p>PCA can reduce the dimension of the data dramatically and without losing too much information when the linear correlations of the data are strong (PCA is based onlinear algebra!).  And in fact you can also measure the actual extent of the information loss and adjust accordingly.) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a very popular technique used by data scientists primarily for dimensionality reduction in numerous applications ranging from stock market prediction to medical image classification. Other uses of PCA include de-noising and feature extraction. PCA is also used as an exploratory data analysis tool. To better understand PCA let\u2019s consider an example dataset composed of the properties of trucks. These properties describe each truck by its color, size, compactness, number of seats, number of doors, size of trunk, and so on. Many of these features measured will be redundant and therefore, we should remove these redundancies and describe each truck with fewer properties. This is precisely what PCA aims to do. PCA is a technique used to compress d features into <code>p&lt;&lt;d</code> features, while preserving as much of the information as possible (~ compression !). A classic demonstration for PCA is given with images. A black and white image can be represented as an n by d matrix of integers, determining the grayscale of each pixel. PCA provides a low-rank (low-dimension) representation of that matrix that can be stored with (n+d) p numbers, instead of nd, such that the compressed image looks almost the same as the original. In the context of machine learning (ML), PCA is a dimension reduction technique. When the number of features is large, ML algorithms either are at risk of overfitting, or require too much time to train. To that end, <code>PCA can reduce the input dimension. The way PCA reduces the dimension is based on correlations. Two features are correlated if, given the value of one, you can make an educated guess about the value of the other</code>. PCA, with a target dimension of p, finds p features such that a linear function of these will do the best job of predicting the original d features. This kind of information-preserving objective makes the output of PCA useful to downstream tasks.</p> <p>Pros:</p> <ul> <li>Relatively computationally cheap.</li> <li>Can save embedding model to then project new data points into the reduced space.</li> </ul> <p>Cons:</p> <ul> <li>Linear reduction limits information that can be captured; not as discriminably clustered as other algorithms.</li> </ul> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/</li> <li>https://dimensionality-reduction-293e465c2a3443e8941b016d.vercel.app/</li> <li>embedding projector - https://projector.tensorflow.org/</li> </ul> <p>See also P, Feature Extraction, Linear Autoencoder, [Linear Discriminant Analysis], [ML Algorithm], Overfitting, Synthesized Variable</p>"},{"location":"glossary/p/#prior","title":"Prior","text":"<p>Can refer either to [prior knowledge] or prior probability</p> <p>See also P, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/p/#prior-belief","title":"Prior Belief","text":"<p>~ What you believe about the data before you begin training on it.

It is based on the notion of a rational agent or intelligent agent using the belief\u2013desire\u2013intention software model. A user application is predominately defined, and provided to a PRS system is a set of knowledge areas. Each knowledge area is a piece of procedural knowledge that specifies how to do something, e.g., how to navigate down a corridor, or how to plan a path (in contrast with robotic architectures where the programmer just provides a model of what the states of the world are and how the agent's primitive actions affect them). Such a program, together with a PRS interpreter, is used to control the agent. The interpreter is responsible for maintaining beliefs about the world state, choosing which goals to attempt to achieve next, and choosing which knowledge area to apply in the current situation. How exactly these operations are performed might depend on domain-specific meta-level knowledge areas. Unlike traditional AI planning systems that generate a complete plan at the beginning, and replan if unexpected things happen, PRS interleaves planning and doing actions in the world. At any point, the system might only have a partially specified plan for the future. PRS is based on the BDI or [Belief-Desire-Intention Framework] for intelligent agents. Beliefs consist of what the agent believes to be true about the current state of the world, desires consist of the agent's goals, and intentions consist of the agent's current plans for achieving those goals.

Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods such as \"chain-of-thought'', which employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other benchmarks. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models.

The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed.\n// 3. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it!\n// 4. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images.\n// 5. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more.\n// 6. Do not create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead.\n// 7. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo).\n// - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya)\n// - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist\n// 8. Diversify depictions with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions.\n// - Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes.\n// - Use all possible different DESCENTS with EQUAL probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have EQUAL probability.\n// - Do not use \"various\" or \"diverse\"\n// - Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality.\n// - Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.\n// - For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations.\n// 9. Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases:\n// - Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. \"Barake Obema\")\n// - If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.\n// - When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying \"president\", \"prime minister\", or \"chancellor\", say \"politician\"; instead of saying \"king\", \"queen\", \"emperor\", or \"empress\", say \"public figure\"; instead of saying \"Pope\" or \"Dalai Lama\", say \"religious figure\"; and so on.\n// 10.

The Q-function is represented as a table or a function that maps state-action pairs to their corresponding Q-values.</p> <p>During the learning process, the RL agent interacts with the environment by taking actions based on its current policy.

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT.

Anomalies can manifest as unexpected spikes in time series data, breaks in periodicity, or unclassifiable data points. They are easy to describe in that, when viewed in a plot, they are often easily distinguishable from the \"regular\" data. Including these anomalies in a dataset can drastically increase the complexity of a machine learning task since the \"regular\" data can often be described with a simple model. With each data point, RCF associates an anomaly score. Low score values indicate that the data point is considered \"normal.\" High values indicate the presence of an anomaly in the data. The definitions of \"low\" and \"high\" depend on the application but common practice suggests that scores beyond three standard deviations from the mean score are considered anomalous. While there are many applications of anomaly detection algorithms to one-dimensional time series data such as traffic volume analysis or sound volume spike detection, RCF is designed to work with arbitrary-dimensional input.

Random Forest is a robust machine learning algorithm that can be used for a variety of tasks including regression and classification.

The random forest model combines the predictions of the estimators to produce a more accurate prediction (strong learner!). Standard decision tree classifiers have the disadvantage that they are prone to overfitting to the training set. The random forest's ensemble design allows the random forest to compensate for this and generalize well to unseen data, including data with missing values.

Jailbreaking is another term for red-teaming wherein the LLM is manipulated to break away from its guardrails. Microsoft\u2019s Chatbot Tay launched in 2016 and the more recent Bing's Chatbot Sydney are real-world examples of how disastrous the lack of thorough evaluation of the underlying ML model using red-teaming can be. The origins of the idea of a red-team traces back to adversary simulations and wargames performed by militaries.</p> <p>The goal of red-teaming language models is to craft a prompt that would trigger the model to generate text that is likely to cause harm. Red-teaming shares some similarities and differences with the more well-known form of evaluation in ML called adversarial attacks. The similarity is that both red-teaming and adversarial attacks share the same goal of \u201cattacking\u201d or \u201cfooling\u201d the model to generate content that would be undesirable in a real-world use case. However, adversarial attacks can be unintelligible to humans, for example, by prefixing the string \u201caaabbbcc\u201d to each prompt because it deteriorates model performance. Many examples of such attacks on various NLP classification and generation tasks is discussed in Wallace et al., \u201819. Red-teaming prompts, on the other hand, look like regular, natural language prompts.</p> <p>Red-teaming can reveal model limitations that can cause upsetting user experiences or enable harm by aiding violence or other unlawful activity for a user with malicious intentions. The outputs from red-teaming (just like adversarial attacks) are generally used to train the model to be less likely to cause harm or steer it away from undesirable outputs.</p> <p>Since red-teaming requires creative thinking of possible model failures, it is a problem with a large search space making it resource intensive. A workaround would be to augment the LLM with a classifier trained to predict whether a given prompt contains topics or phrases that can possibly lead to offensive generations and if the classifier predicts the prompt would lead to a potentially offensive text, generate a canned response. Such a strategy would err on the side of caution. But that would be very restrictive and cause the model to be frequently evasive. So, there is tension between the model being helpful (by following instructions) and being harmless (or at least less likely to enable harm).</p> <p>The red team can be a human-in-the-loop or an LM that is testing another LM for harmful outputs. Coming up with red-teaming prompts for models that are fine-tuned for safety and alignment (such as via RLHF or SFT) requires creative thinking in the form of roleplay attacks wherein the LLM is instructed to behave as a malicious character as in Ganguli et al., \u201822 Instructing the model to respond in code instead of natural language can also reveal the model\u2019s learned biases such as examples below.</p> <p></p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://huggingface.co/blog/red-teaming</li> <li>papers<ul> <li>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125</li> <li>Anthropic paper - Red Teaming Language Models to Reduce Harms: Methods, Scaling Behaviors, and Lessons Learned - https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07858</li> <li>Red Teaming Language Models with Language Models - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03286</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also R, Supervised Fine-Tuning</p>"},{"location":"glossary/r/#reducible-error","title":"Reducible Error","text":"<p>Suppose that we want to predict a value Y based upon a set X = (X1, X2, \u2026, Xp) of variables. For the predictions to have any chance of being good predictions, X needs to contain the core set of variables that drive the behavior of Y. But there will almost always be lesser variables, not included in X, that nonetheless exert some minor influence on Y. We capture the situation as follows:</p> <pre><code> Y = f(X) + \u025b \n</code></pre> <p>Here, f is the function describing the relationship between X and Y, and \u025b is an error term that accounts for all the unmeasured influences on Y. We assume that \u025b is independent of X and has mean 0.</p> <p>Usually we don\u2019t know f exactly, so we use statistical methods (such as linear regression) to estimate f. We use f\u0302 to denote this estimate. This allows us to predict Y from X using the following:</p> <pre><code> Y =  f\u0302(X) + \u025b \n</code></pre> <p>Our predictions will generally be imperfect: there will be some nonzero difference between the predicted and \u201ctrue\u201d values. This difference is called prediction error. In general we can\u2019t see the true values directly, but we can see evidence of the gap by looking at the [Residuals], which are the difference between the observed and predicted values.</p> <p>To minimize prediction error, we need to understand its source. Broadly speaking there are two: reducible error and irreducible error.</p> <p>Reducible error is the error arising from the mismatch between f\u0302 and f. f is the true relationship between X and Y, but we can\u2019t see f directly\u2014 we can only estimate it. We can reduce the gap between our estimate and the true function by applying improved methods.</p> <p>Irreducible error arises from the fact that X doesn\u2019t completely determine Y. That is, there are variables outside of X \u2014 and independent of X\u2014 that still have some small effect on Y. The only way to improve prediction error related to irreducible error is to identify these outside influences and incorporate them as predictors.</p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://medium.com/wwblog/reducible-vs-irreducible-error-e469036969fa</li> </ul> <p>See also R, Loss Function</p>"},{"location":"glossary/r/#reducible-loss","title":"Reducible Loss","text":"<p>See Reducible Error</p>"},{"location":"glossary/r/#reflex-model","title":"Reflex Model","text":"<p>An inference you can make almost instantaneously.

Continue doing the behavior that led you to the most reward. Imagine teaching a program to play chess. It level of playing is only as good as the training data provided. If it learns/analyses the games played by average players, the program will only be average. If it analyses the games of the best player in the work, it will be just as good as them, but not better. <code>Reinforcement learning is the way to make a computer be better  than human at chess or any other activity</code> using rewards and punishments. <code>Learning through trials and errors</code> input/sensor --&gt; software agent --&gt; Action, leads to [supervised feedback] in the form of a reward.</p> <p>The RL agent continuously learns. There is no final state. Gives a reward for each move. Get's better based on past-experience.</p> <p><code>Reinforcement learning is located near the supervised end of the spectrum</code>. Unlike supervised learning, reinforcement learning programs do not learn from labeled pairs of inputs and outputs. Instead, they receive feedback for their decisions, but errors are not explicitly corrected. For example, a reinforcement learning program that is learning to play a side-scrolling video game like Super Mario Bros may receive a reward when it completes a level or exceeds a certain score, and a punishment when it loses a life. However, this [supervised feedback] is not associated with specific decisions to run, avoid Goombas, or pick up fire flowers.</p> <p></p> <p>Imagine a mouse in a maze trying to find hidden pieces of cheese. The more times we expose the mouse to the maze, the better it gets at finding the cheese. At first, the mouse might move randomly, but after some time, the mouse\u2019s experience helps it realize which actions bring it closer to the cheese. The process for the mouse mirrors what we do with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train a system or a game. Generally speaking, RL is a [machine learning] method that helps an RL agent learn from experience. By recording actions and using a trial-and-error approach in a set environment, RL can maximize a cumulative reward. In our example, the mouse is the RL agent and the maze is the environment. The set of possible actions for the mouse are: move front, back, left or right. The reward is the cheese.</p> <p>You can use RL when you have little to no historical data about a problem, because it doesn\u2019t need information in advance (unlike traditional machine learning methods). In a RL framework, you learn from the data as you go. Not surprisingly, RL is especially successful with games, especially games of \u201cperfect information\u201d like chess and Go. With games, feedback from the RL agent and the environment comes quickly, allowing the model to learn fast. The downside of RL is that it can take a very long time to train if the problem is complex. Just as IBM\u2019s Deep Blue beat the best human chess player in 1997, AlphaGo, a RL-based algorithm, beat the best Go player in 2016. The current pioneers of RL are the teams at DeepMind in the UK. </p> <p>On April, 2019, the OpenAI Five team was the first AI to beat a world champion team of e-sport Dota 2, a very complex video game that the OpenAI Five team chose because there were no RL algorithms that were able to win it at the time. The same AI team that beat Dota 2\u2019s champion human team also developed a robotic hand that can reorient a block. </p> <p>This category of AI algorithms involves a feedback loop that comes back to adjust decision variables in order to improve decision-making over time.

It was developed by Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s.</p> <p>SOM is a type of artificial neural network that learns to represent the input data in a lower-dimensional grid or map while preserving the topological relationships between the data points. The algorithm organizes the input data based on their similarity, grouping similar instances together in the map.</p> <p>Here's a general overview of how SOM works:   1. Initialization: SOM starts by initializing a grid of neurons, each representing a specific location in the map. Each neuron is associated with a weight vector of the same dimensionality as the input data.   1. Training: The algorithm iteratively presents input data samples to the SOM. For each input sample, the algorithm finds the best matching unit (BMU), which is the neuron with weight vector closest to the input sample in terms of similarity (e.g., using Euclidean distance).   1. Neighborhood Update: After finding the BMU, the algorithm updates the weights of the BMU and its neighboring neurons in the map. The update is performed to move the weights closer to the input sample, encouraging nearby neurons to become more similar to the BMU.   1. Iteration: The training process repeats for a specified number of iterations or until convergence. As the training progresses, the map self-organizes, and similar input samples tend to be grouped together.   1. Visualization and Clustering: Once trained, the SOM can be used for various purposes. It can be used to visualize the high-dimensional input data in a lower-dimensional map, providing insights into the underlying structure of the data. Additionally, the SOM can be used for clustering by assigning new instances to the cluster associated with the BMU or by grouping instances that are close to each other in the map.</p> <p>SOM is particularly useful for visualizing and exploring high-dimensional data, discovering clusters or patterns, and reducing the dimensionality of data for subsequent analysis.

SARSA stands for State-Action-Reward-State-Action, which reflects the sequence of information that the algorithm uses to learn.</p> <p>Like Q-learning, SARSA is a value-based algorithm that aims to learn an optimal policy for decision-making in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). It is suitable for problems with discrete state and action spaces.</p> <p>In SARSA, the agent interacts with the environment by taking actions based on its current policy. After each action, the agent receives a reward and transitions to a new state. SARSA updates its Q-values based on the observed state, action, reward, and the next state and action taken by following the current policy.</p> <p>The SARSA update rule uses a form of temporal difference learning, similar to Q-learning and based on the Bellman equation. It updates the Q-value of the previous state-action pair based on the reward received, the Q-value of the next state-action pair, and the agent's learning rate and discount factor.</p> <p>The key difference between SARSA and Q-learning lies in the way they update their Q-values. While Q-learning uses the maximum Q-value of the next state to update the Q-value of the current state-action pair, SARSA uses the Q-value of the next state-action pair that the agent actually chooses based on its current policy. In other words, SARSA is an on-policy algorithm that updates its Q-values based on the actions it takes during the learning process.</p> <p>SARSA has been successfully applied in various domains, including game playing, robotics, and control systems.

Explicitly trained to work on long sequences</p> <p>A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and [Transformers] have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of 10000 or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental State Space Model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D [ResNet], (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation 60\u00d7 faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.</p> <p></p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>explanation - https://srush.github.io/annotated-s4/</li> <li>paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396</li> <li>code - https://github.com/state-spaces/s4</li> <li>articles<ul> <li>https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2022-01-14-s4-1</li> <li>https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2022-01-14-s4-2</li> <li>https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2022-01-14-s4-3</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also S, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/s/#style-gan","title":"Style GAN","text":"<p>Other GANs focused on improving the discriminator in this case we improve the generator.

You\u2019ve spent months training a high-quality model to classify images as shirts, t-shirts and polos. Your new task is to build a similar model to classify images of dresses as jeans, cargo, casual, and dress pants. Can you transfer the knowledge built into the first model and apply it to the second model? Yes, you can, using Transfer Learning. <code>Transfer Learning refers to re-using part of a previously trained neural net and adapting it to a new but similar task</code> Specifically, once you train a neural net using data for a task, you can transfer a fraction of the trained layers and combine them with a few new layers that you can train using the data of the new task. By adding a few layers, the new neural net can learn and adapt quickly to the new task. The main advantage of transfer learning is that you need less data to train the neural net, which is particularly important because training for deep learning algorithms is expensive in terms of both time and money (computational resources) \u2014 and of course it\u2019s often very difficult to find enough labeled data for the training. Let\u2019s return to our example and assume that for the shirt model you use a neural net with 20 hidden layers. After running a few experiments, you realize that you can transfer 18 of the shirt model layers and combine them with one new layer of parameters to train on the images of pants. The pants model would therefore have 19 hidden layers. The inputs and outputs of the two tasks are different but the re-usable layers may be summarizing information that is relevant to both, for example aspects of cloth. Transfer learning has become more and more popular and there are now many solid pre-trained models available for common deep learning tasks like image and text classification.</p> <p>Transfer learning is one of the most useful discoveries to come out of the computer vision community. Stated simply, transfer learning allows one model that was trained on different types of images, e.g. dogs vs cats, to be used for a different set of images, e.g. planes vs trains, while reducing the training time dramatically. When Google released !ImageNet, they stated it took them over 14 days to train the model on some of the most powerful GPUs available at the time. Now, with transfer learning, we will train an, albeit smaller, model in less than 5 minutes.</p> <p></p> <p>To execute transfer learning, transfer the weights of the trained model to the new one. Those weights can be retrained entirely, partially (layering), or not at all (prepend a new process such as classification on an encoder output!)

Whereas older sequence models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks] process data sequentially, the Transformer processes data in parallel (can therefore be parallelised on machines in the cloud!). This allows them to process massive amounts of available training data by using powerful GPU-based compute resources. Furthermore, traditional RNNs and LSTMs can have difficulty modeling the long-term dependencies of a sequence because they can forget earlier parts of the sequence. Transformers use an attention mechanism to overcome this memory shortcoming by directing each step of the output sequence to pay \u201cattention\u201d to relevant parts of the input sequence. For example, when a Transformer-based conversational AI model is asked \u201cHow is the weather now?\u201d and the model replies \u201cIt is warm and sunny today,\u201d the attention mechanism guides the model to focus on the word \u201cweather\u201d when answering with \u201cwarm\u201d and \u201csunny,\u201d and to focus on \u201cnow\u201d when answering with \u201ctoday.\u201d This is different from traditional RNNs and LSTMs, which process sentences from left to right and forget the context of each word as the distance between the words increases.</p> <ul> <li>word positioning (feed the work and its position in the sentence)</li> <li>Attention</li> <li>self-attention (link pronouns, subject to verbs, adjectives to nouns, adverbs)</li> <li>cross-attention (positioning of words between languages, i.e. input and output)</li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The transformer is a current-state of the art NLP model.

The key enhancements in TD3 address issues such as overestimation of Q-values and instability in training.</p> <p>Here are the main features and components of the TD3 algorithm:   1. Twin Networks: TD3 employs two sets of deep Q-networks, known as twin networks. Having two separate networks reduces the overestimation bias commonly encountered in [value-based methods].   1. Delayed Updates: TD3 introduces delayed updates for the target networks. Instead of updating the target networks at every time step, the updates are performed less frequently. This helps stabilize the learning process and mitigates the issues related to correlated samples.   1. Target Policy Smoothing: To further improve stability, TD3 applies target policy smoothing. It adds noise to the target actions during the learning process, encouraging the agent to explore different actions and reducing the sensitivity to small policy updates.   1. Replay Buffer: TD3 utilizes an experience replay buffer, which stores past experiences (state, action, reward, next state) for training. The replay buffer helps to decorrelate samples and provides a diverse set of experiences for learning.   1. Actor-Critic Architecture: TD3 combines an actor network, which generates actions based on the current state, and a critic network, which estimates the Q-value for state-action pairs. Both networks are typically implemented using deep neural networks.</p> <p>Through iterations of interacting with the environment, collecting experiences, and updating the network parameters using [gradient descent], TD3 aims to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward.

Now, whenever the accuracy of model on validation data is greater than that on training data then the model is said to have generalized well. </p> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/training-vs-testing-vs-validation-sets/</li> <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets#Validation_data_set</li> </ul> <p>See also V, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/v/#value","title":"Value","text":"<p>In Reinforcement Learning, ...</p> <p>See also V, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/v/#value-based-algorithm","title":"Value-Based Algorithm","text":"<p>~ a class of [Reinforcement Learning Algorithms]</p> <p>See also V, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/v/#vanilla","title":"Vanilla","text":"<p>The most basic version of a model</p> <p>See also V, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/v/#vanilla-gan","title":"Vanilla GAN","text":"<p>The Vanilla GAN is the simplest type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) made up of the generator and discriminator , where the classification and generation of images is done by the generator and discriminator internally which both use the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Architecture.

Vanishing Gradient Problem is a difficulty found in training certain Artificial Neural Networks with gradient based methods (e.g Back Propagation). In particular, this problem makes it really hard to learn and tune the parameters of the earlier layers in the network. This problem becomes worse as the number of layers in the architecture increases.  This is not a fundamental problem with neural networks - it's a problem with gradient based learning methods caused by certain activation functions. Let's try to intuitively understand the problem and the cause behind it. </p> <ul> <li>Problem ==&gt; Gradient based methods learn a parameter's value by understanding how a small change in the parameter's value will affect the network's output. If a change in the parameter's value causes very small change in the network's output - the network just can't learn the parameter effectively, which is a problem. This is exactly what's happening in the vanishing gradient problem -- the gradients of the network's output with respect to the parameters in the early layers become extremely small. That's a fancy way of saying that even a large change in the value of parameters for the early layers doesn't have a big effect on the output. Let's try to understand when and why does this problem happen. </li> <li>Cause ==&gt; Vanishing gradient problem depends on the choice of the activation function. Many common activation functions (e.g sigmoid or tanh) 'squash' their input into a very small output range in a very non-linear fashion. For example, sigmoid maps the real number line onto a \"small\" range of [0, 1], especially with the function being very flat on most of the number-line. As a result, there are large regions of the input space which are mapped to an extremely small range. In these regions of the input space, even a large change in the input will produce a small change in the output - hence the gradient is small.  This becomes much worse when we stack multiple layers of such non-linearities on top of each other. For instance, first layer will map a large input region to a smaller output region, which will be mapped to an even smaller region by the second layer, which will be mapped to an even smaller region by the third layer and so on. As a result, even a large change in the parameters of the first layer doesn't change the output much.</li> </ul> <p>To minimize this problem, you can try to</p> <ul> <li>use the ReLU activation function over the sigmoid ones. ReLU which NOT cause a small derivative if &gt;= 0.</li> <li>reduce the number of layers in the network (minimize total loss by reducing the number of times the signal goes through an activation function), </li> <li>use batch normalization (don't reach the outer edges of the sigmoid function) = work in a regime (input value range) where the derivative is not zero </li> <li>change model architecture</li> <li>and/or use residual networks as they provide residual connections straight to earlier layers. The residual connection directly adds the value at the beginning of the block, x, to the end of the block (F(x)+x). This residual connection doesn\u2019t go through activation functions that \u201csquashes\u201d the derivatives, resulting in a higher overall derivative of the block.</li> </ul> <p>More at </p> <ul> <li>https://towardsdatascience.com/the-vanishing-gradient-problem-69bf08b15484</li> <li>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-vanishing-gradient-problem</li> <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem</li> </ul> <p>See also V, Activation Function, Batch Normalization, Exploding Gradient Problem, [Rectified Linear Unit], [Residual Network Model]</p>"},{"location":"glossary/v/#variable","title":"Variable","text":"<p>See also V, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/v/#variable-model","title":"Variable Model","text":"<p>See also V, Bayesian Network, Constraint Satisfaction Problem, Model Type</p>"},{"location":"glossary/v/#variable-type","title":"Variable Type","text":"<ul> <li>Continuous variable</li> <li>Discrete variable</li> </ul> <p>See also V, Continuous Variable, Discrete Variable</p>"},{"location":"glossary/v/#variance","title":"Variance","text":"<p>~ the amount that the prediction will change if you change the training data</p> <p> a lot of flexibility in the model causes high variance.</p> <p> models such as random Forests and Neural Networks tend to have high variance</p> <p>How dispersed your predicted values are.

Here's a deeper look at how they\u2019re used:</p> <ol> <li>Representation of Data: Data in machine learning is often represented in numerical form as vectors. For instance, each point in a dataset can be thought of as a vector where each element represents a feature. In natural language processing (NLP), words are often represented as vectors (like in Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings) that capture semantic meaning based on their relationships to other words.</li> <li>Operations in Vector Spaces: In AI, vector spaces allow for mathematical operations like addition, scaling, and finding angles (cosine similarity), which can indicate how similar two vectors are. For example, in NLP, the vectors for \"king\" and \"queen\" are often close in the vector space, reflecting their semantic similarity.</li> <li>Training and Transformations: Machine learning models operate on data in vector spaces by learning patterns and transformations in this space. For example, in neural networks, layers apply transformations to move data through different vector spaces to identify features and relationships in the data.</li> <li>Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) reduce high-dimensional vector spaces into lower dimensions, helping visualize data and speed up computations while retaining meaningful structure.</li> </ol> <p>So, vector spaces form the foundation of data representation in AI/ML, enabling models to learn, compare, and make decisions based on the relationships between data points within these spaces.</p> <p>See also V, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/v/#vector-space-collision","title":"Vector Space Collision","text":"<p>Here is a brief overview of vector space collisions in machine learning:</p> <ul> <li>In machine learning models like word embeddings or recommendation engines, items are often represented as vectors in a high-dimensional vector space.</li> <li>The vectors are positioned in the space such that similar items are close together based on certain metrics like cosine similarity.

For example, carrots, celery, and cucumbers would all have relatively similar representations, which would be very different from the representations of airplane, sunglasses, and toothpaste.</p> <p>~ <code>Take a sparse vector as input to a word2vec process and turn into a point in the embedding space, where 2 close related words (in meaning) are close (at a small euclidian distance)</code>. TFM and [TFIDF] are numerical representations of text documents that only consider frequency and weighted frequencies to represent text documents. By contrast, word embeddings can capture the context of a word in a document (e.g. \"bank\" in bank account and river bank have different embeddings). With the word context, embeddings can quantify the similarity between words, which in turn allows us to do arithmetic with words. Word2Vec is a method based on neural nets that maps words in a corpus to a numerical vector. We can then use these vectors to find synonyms, perform arithmetic operations with words, or to represent text documents (by taking the mean of all the word vectors in a document). For example, let\u2019s assume that we use a sufficiently big corpus of text documents to estimate word embeddings. Let\u2019s also assume that the words king, queen, man and woman are part of the corpus. Let say that vector(\u2018word\u2019) is the numerical vector that represents the word \u2018word\u2019. To estimate vector(\u2018woman\u2019), we can perform the arithmetic operation with vectors:</p> <pre><code>vector(\u2018king\u2019) + vector(\u2018woman\u2019) \u2014 vector(\u2018man\u2019) ~ vector(\u2018queen\u2019)\n</code></pre> <p>Word representations allow finding similarities between words by computing the cosine similarity between the vector representation of two words. The cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors. We compute word embeddings using machine learning methods, but that\u2019s often a pre-step to applying a machine learning algorithm on top. For instance, suppose we have access to the tweets of several thousand Twitter users. Also suppose that we know which of these Twitter users bought a house. To predict the probability of a new Twitter user buying a house, we can combine Word2Vec with a [logistic regression]. You can train word embeddings yourself or get a pre-trained (transfer learning) set of word vectors. To download pre-trained word vectors in 157 different languages, take a look at FastText.</p> <p>Context-free examples:</p> <ul> <li>Word2Vec \u2013 Predicts a word given its context (CBOW) or predicts the context given a word (Skip-gram). For example, in the phrase \u201cThe bird sat in the tree,\u201d Word2Vec can learn that \u201cbird\u201d and \u201ctree\u201d often appear in similar contexts, capturing their relationship. This is useful for tasks like word similarity and analogy detection.</li> <li>GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) \u2013 Uses matrix factorization techniques on the word co-occurrence matrix to find word embeddings. For instance, GloVe can learn that \u201ccheese\u201d and \u201cmayo\u201d are related to \u201csandwich\u201d by analyzing the co-occurrence patterns across a large corpus. This approach is great for applications like semantic search and clustering that need to understand broader relationships among words.</li> <li>FastText \u2013 An extension of Word2Vec by Facebook, FastText considers subword information, making it effective for morphologically rich languages. It represents words as bags of character n-grams, which helps in understanding rare words and misspellings. For example, it can recognize that \u201crunning\u201d and \u201crunner\u201d share a common subword structure.</li> </ul> <p>Context-full examples:</p> <ul> <li>ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) \u2013 Generates word representations that are functions of the entire input sentence, capturing context-sensitive meanings.

For example, in the sentence \u201cShe went to the bank to deposit money,\u201d BERT uses the preceding words \u201cShe went to the\u201d and the following words \u201cto deposit money\u201d to determine that \u201cbank\u201d refers to a financial institution, not a riverbank.</li> </ul> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>tutorial - https://txt.cohere.com/sentence-word-embeddings/</li> <li>articles<ul> <li>LLM embedding - https://www.iguazio.com/glossary/llm-embeddings/</li> <li>https://www.louisbouchard.ai/text-embedding/</li> <li>https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embeddings-4cf857b12edc</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also W, NLP, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/w/#word-embedding-space","title":"Word Embedding Space","text":"<p>In natural language processing, word embeddings are numerical representations of words so that similar words have close representations.

Zero-shot learning is the ability of a model to perform a task without having seen any example of that kind in the past; the model is supposed to understand the task without looking at any examples.  Use near comparables. when not enough data --&gt; get info from other source in different format, i.e. words for image. You have seen many cats and dogs, but you have never seen a horse in the data. Pick attributes of ... ex number of legs. (classification based on the attributes) A horse has fur, 4 legs, in a range of colors, .... you are a horse. You need a predefined map of attributes (maybe by reading an encyclopedia) and look for those attributes in the image classifier. Few-, one-, and zero-shot settings are specialized cases of zero-shot task transfer. In a few-shot setting, the model is provided with a task description and as many examples as fit into the context window of the model. In a one-shot setting, the model is provided with exactly one example and, in a zero-shot setting, with no example.</p> <p></p> <p>In Zero-Shot Learning, the data consists of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Seen Classes: These are the data classes that have been used to train the deep learning model.</li> <li>Unseen Classes: These are the data classes on which the existing deep model needs to generalize. Data from these classes were not used during training.</li> <li>Auxiliary Information: Since no labeled instances belonging to the unseen classes are available, some auxiliary information is necessary to solve the Zero-Shot Learning problem. Such auxiliary information should contain information about all of the unseen classes, which can be descriptions, semantic information, or word embeddings.</li> </ul> <p></p> To find a horse using a cat-dog model, do we need to build the model using the semantic attributes for the cat and dog? i.e the semantic attribute that will be used to find the horse (ex: has a tail, fur, color is brown, black, or white, etc) <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/zeroshot</li> </ul> <p>See also Z, Data Augmentation, Few-Shot Learning, Image Classifier, Insufficient Data Algorithm, One-Shot Learning, Semantic Space, Zero-Shot Task Transfer</p>"},{"location":"glossary/z/#zero-shot-prompting","title":"Zero-Shot Prompting","text":"<p>~ Zero-shot learning applied to prompt engineering</p> <pre><code># Prompt\nClassify the text into neutral, negative or positive. \nText: I think the vacation is okay.\nSentiment:\n\n# Output\nNeutral\n</code></pre> <p>More at:</p> <ul> <li>https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/zeroshot</li> </ul> <p>See also Z, ...</p>"},{"location":"glossary/z/#zero-shot-task-transfer","title":"Zero-Shot Task Transfer","text":"<p>Zero-shot task transfer is a setting in which the model is presented with few to no examples and asked to understand the task based on the examples and an instruction.
