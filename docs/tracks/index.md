# Educational Tracks  {: style="text-align: center;"}

 As a non-profit, we provide an environment for middle and high-school students to safely explore AI through math, projects, use-cases, research, events, and competitions. Beyond mere discussion and theoretical learning, students actively engage with AI, gaining hands-on experience and interpersonal skills.

 If you are interested in becoming a [member](/forms/membership.md){ .shaking } or in helping as a [mentor](/forms/mentorship.md){ .shaking }, we welcome all motivated minds to join and contribute to Midtown AI.

-   ## [Math Circle](math_circle.md) {: style="text-align: center;"}

    AI involves a lot of problem solving. Moreover AI is rarely done in isolation. By working through math problems and proofs, middle and high-school students will develop skills similar to those required for building and debugging AI systems. Our math circle allows for student collaboration and teamwork - being able to work together on complex math problems translates well to collaborating on AI projects.

    In the club, students will:

    * Work in teams through math competition-style problems, puzzles and games that require logic, pattern recognition, and problem decomposition.
    * Build strong math skills in areas like linear algebra, statistics, probability, and calculus
    * Discuss the mathematics behind algorithms and optimization techniques.
    * Acquire the mindset of simplifying problems, analyzing them, and finding solutions.

-   ## [DeepRacer](deepracer.md) {: style="text-align: center;"}

    AWS DeepRacer allows middle and high-school students to get hands-on with machine learning by building their own autonomous race car models and compete in races using reinforcement learning.

    In the club, students will:

    * Learn fundamentals of AI, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles
    * Use AWS to train reinforcement learning models to optimize a virtual race car
    * Tune hyperparameters and adjust reward functions to improve model performance
    * Compete in simulated races against other club members
    * Have the opportunity to qualify for the global AWS DeepRacer League virtual circuit

    A good grasp of the core concepts of Python is advised for this track.
