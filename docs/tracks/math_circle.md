-   ## Why math? {: .center-text }

    Talking about math in an AI club is not only relevant but also essential. Mathematics serves as the fundamental language of artificial intelligence. Many AI algorithms, models, and techniques are rooted in mathematical principles. Understanding math is crucial for comprehending how AI works.

    Developing AI algorithms often involves complex mathematical operations and concepts. Discussions on linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and statistics are common when designing, implementing, and optimizing AI algorithms.

    Training a machine learning model is a mathematical process. Topics like optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent), loss functions, and regularization techniques require mathematical understanding to train models effectively.

-   ## Math as a language {: .center-text }

    Mathematics is often referred to as a language because, like natural languages such as English, it allows us to convey complex ideas and concepts. It is precise, universal, logical, structured, and best of all understood by machines. You may already speak a foreign language, but can you communicate in math and program a self-driving car to take you home without a scratch?

    In the context of building AI, mathematics plays a crucial role because it provides the tools and language to describe algorithms, model data, and analyze the behavior of AI systems. While it's a challenging task to program a self-driving car to take you safely anywhere, mathematics, along with computer science and engineering, is instrumental in making this ambitious goal a reality. So, do you speak math?

-   ## Team-based learning {: .center-text }

    In school, a math test is a solo effort, which emphasises individual performance, where students work independently to solve problems. Math tests are known to lead to stress and anxiety for some students.

    In our club, our team-based math learning encourages collaboration and peer-to-peer teaching. Students can discuss and solve math problems together. When one team member understands a topic, they can help explain it to others, reinforcing their own knowledge in the process.

    In a team of individuals with different levels of mathematical proficiency and ways of thinking, the diversity can lead to a rich exchange of ideas. Students can learn from one another's unique perspectives and insights.

    Challenging math problems push you to think critically and deeply about mathematical concepts. They stimulate your intellectual growth by requiring you to apply your problem-solving skills in novel and complex ways.

## Challenging math ... at your level!

Challenging math problems push you to think critically and deeply about mathematical concepts. They stimulate your intellectual growth by requiring you to apply your knowledge and problem-solving skills in novel and complex ways. There is nothing like overcoming a challenging problem on your own.

However, when you collaborate within a team, you tap into the collective brainpower of all team members. Each member brings their knowledge, skills, and experiences to the table, making it easier to tackle complex problems that are challenging for an individual.Team members often possess complementary skills. For instance, one member might excel in algebra while another is strong in geometry. By combining these skills, a team can cover a wider range of mathematical topics and techniques. Better yet, team members learn from each other.

The shared responsibility and support from teammates can alleviate anxiety and foster a more relaxed problem-solving environment. Challenging math problems are less stressful when addressed collaboratively. As a team, solving problems boost the confidence of each individual. Knowing that you contributed to a collective accomplishment is undoubtedly personally satisfying.
