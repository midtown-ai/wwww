# Getting started with linear regression
<!-- end-of-excerpt -->

3:05 PM - Track starts
 * Name tags distribution
 * Vocal warm-up: Introductions and share an exciting moment of your week.

3:10 PM - How does an AI algorithm use math to learn?

In this lesson, students will explore one of the more straightforward ways to get started with machine learning: Linear Regression!

 * Slide preview - [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KD9nWSZ2Otx8JU4m_gZHKWVDnwUI86xBYOGwYPEmtpI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KD9nWSZ2Otx8JU4m_gZHKWVDnwUI86xBYOGwYPEmtpI/edit?usp=sharing)
 * Introduction video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUPagM-OB_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUPagM-OB_M)
 * Questions:
   * What are statistics?
   * What is a regression? What are linear regressions?
   * Can you give examples of linear regression?
   * What are independent variables?
   * What are the slope and intercept of a line? What does a negative/positive slope/intercept mean?
   * What is the Mean Square Error (MSE)? Why not use the Mean Absolute Error? When is MAE > or < to  MSE?
   * How is that line found? Do you remember gradient descent? Can I find the equation of the line directly?

 * Activities:
   * Find the best fit - [https://www.geogebra.org/m/tn7wppdp#material/dlsxY1uX](https://www.geogebra.org/m/tn7wppdp#material/dlsxY1uX)
   * Adding/removing samples - [https://observablehq.com/@yizhe-ang/interactive-visualization-of-linear-regression](https://observablehq.com/@yizhe-ang/interactive-visualization-of-linear-regression)
   * Math worksheet - [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14J51W8YGpUD5DhtNLDqU_kg2x_8oTWabQaDGNPvDn80/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14J51W8YGpUD5DhtNLDqU_kg2x_8oTWabQaDGNPvDn80/edit?usp=sharing)
   * Given 3 samples of your choice, can you calculate the equation of the line?

 * Feedback on materials

 * If time permits
   * More advanced video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtsRRUddV2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtsRRUddV2s)
   * Questions:
     * What are multivariate regressions?
     * What are non-linear features?
     * Can you give examples of such regressions?

4:30 PM - Track ends
