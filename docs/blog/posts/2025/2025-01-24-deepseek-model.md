# DeepSeek

DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company, founded in 2023 by entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, that has rapidly gained attention for developing advanced, open-source large language models (LLMs). Based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and funded by the hedge fund High-Flyer, DeepSeek focuses on creating efficient AI models that rival those of established tech giants.

In January 2025, DeepSeek released its AI assistant, powered by the DeepSeek-V3 model, which quickly became the most-downloaded free app on the U.S. iOS App Store, surpassing competitors like ChatGPT. This success led to significant market reactions, including a substantial decline in Nvidia's stock value.

Overall, DeepSeek's emergence has sparked discussions about the future of AI development, the balance between open-source and proprietary models, and the global dynamics of technological innovation.<!-- end-of-excerpt -->

## What is DeepSeek?

DeepSeek, for those unaware, is a lot like ChatGPT — there’s a website and a mobile app, and you can type into a little text box and have it talk back to you. What makes it special is how it was built. On January 20th, the startup’s most recent major release, a reasoning model called R1, dropped just weeks after the company’s last model V3, both of which began showing some very impressive AI benchmark performance. It quickly became clear that DeepSeek’s models perform at the same level, or in some cases even better, as competing ones from OpenAI, Meta, and Google. Also: they’re totally free to use.

## Who is Liang Wenfeng?

Liang Wenfeng, born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, China, is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur known for his significant contributions to artificial intelligence (AI) and finance. He earned both his bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering from Zhejiang University, focusing on electronic information and communication engineering.

In 2015, Liang co-founded High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, a hedge fund that utilizes AI and machine learning for quantitative trading strategies. Under his leadership, High-Flyer has managed assets totaling over 100 billion yuan (approximately $13.79 billion) by the end of 2021.

Building on his success in finance, Liang founded DeepSeek in 2023, an AI startup dedicated to advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI). DeepSeek has gained international attention for developing advanced AI models that rival those of leading global tech companies, achieving these milestones with significantly lower costs. Notably, DeepSeek's models are open-source, promoting accessibility and collaboration within the AI community.
