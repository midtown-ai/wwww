## Parameter

 A model parameter is something that the ML can learn from the data. For example, the weight of an input in a perceptron. Indeed the model has to have parameters to make predictions. This "parameters" are not set by humans. Hyperparameters cannot be learned from the data and are set by humans. Ex: number of layers in the neural network. 

  * GPT-3 possesses 175 billion weights connecting the equivalent of 8.3 million neurons arranged 384 layers deep.

## Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-Aware Adaptation (PEQA)

 [Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)] methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive cost of full fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the enormous size of LLMs impedes routine deployment. To address the issue, we present Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA), a novel quantization-aware [PEFT] technique that facilitates model compression and accelerates inference. PEQA operates through a dual-stage process: initially, the parameter matrix of each fully-connected layer undergoes quantization into a matrix of low-bit integers and a scalar vector; subsequently, fine-tuning occurs on the scalar vector for each downstream task. Such a strategy compresses the size of the model considerably, leading to a lower inference latency upon deployment and a reduction in the overall memory required. At the same time, fast fine-tuning and efficient task switching becomes possible. In this way, PEQA offers the benefits of quantization, while inheriting the advantages of [PEFT]. We compare PEQA with competitive baselines in comprehensive experiments ranging from natural language understanding to generation benchmarks. This is done using large language models of up to 65 billion parameters, demonstrating PEQA's scalability, task-specific adaptation performance, and ability to follow instructions, even in extremely low-bit settings.

## Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods enable efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters. Fine-tuning large-scale PLMs is often prohibitively costly. In this regard, PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs. Recent State-of-the-Art PEFT techniques achieve performance comparable to that of full fine-tuning.

## Parent Document Retrieval

 A method of [vector retrieval].

 Parent Document Retriever is a form of [multi-vector retrieval], a class of retrieval methods  by which the builder embeds alternative representations of their original documents. These alternative embeddings will be then used in the similarity process to compare with the query the user or application gives.

 In the case of the parent document retriever, the original large chunks will be further split into 'child' chunks.

 Instead of returning the child chunks as context, the Parent Document Retriever will return the parents documents (red boxes below) of those child docs (blue boxes below).

## Particule Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm

 PSO was first intended for simulating social behaviour, as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. 

 PSO is a [metaheuristic] as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as [gradient descent] and quasi-newton methods. However, [metaheuristics] such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found.

## Passive Learning

 The main hypothesis in active learning is that if a learning algorithm can choose the data it wants to learn from, it can perform better than traditional methods with substantially less data for training. But what are these traditional methods exactly? These are tasks which involve gathering a large amount of data randomly sampled from the underlying distribution and using this large dataset to train a model that can perform some sort of prediction. You will call this typical method passive learning. One of the more time-consuming tasks in passive learning is collecting labelled data. In many settings, there can be limiting factors that hamper gathering large amounts of labelled data.

## Pathways Autoregressive Text-To-Image (Parti) Model

 We introduce the Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image model (Parti), an autoregressive text-to-image generation model that achieves high-fidelity photorealistic image generation and supports content-rich synthesis involving complex compositions and world knowledge. Recent advances with diffusion models for text-to-image generation, such as Google’s Imagen, have also shown impressive capabilities and state-of-the-art performance on research benchmarks. Parti and Imagen are complementary in exploring two different families of generative models – autoregressive and diffusion, respectively – opening exciting opportunities for combinations of these two powerful models.

 Parti treats text-to-image generation as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem, analogous to machine translation – this allows it to benefit from advances in large language models, especially capabilities that are unlocked by scaling data and model sizes. In this case, the target outputs are sequences of image tokens instead of text tokens in another language. Parti uses the powerful image tokenizer, ViT-VQGAN, to encode images as sequences of discrete tokens, and takes advantage of its ability to reconstruct such image token sequences as high quality, visually diverse images.

## Perceptron

 A neural network consisting of only 1 layer and 1 neuron.

 Note that a perceptron is a prototype of a modern [artificial neuron] , except it does not have an [activation function] ? Not sure!

 The perceptron was invented in 1943 by McCulloch and Pitts.

 In machine learning, the perceptron (or McCulloch-Pitts neuron) is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.[1] It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

## Pixel RNN

 [Autoregressive models][Autoregressive Model] such as PixelRNN instead train a network that models the conditional distribution of every individual pixel given previous pixels (to the left and to the top). This is similar to plugging the pixels of the image into a char-rnn, but the RNNs run both horizontally and vertically over the image instead of just a 1D sequence of characters. PixelRNNs have a very simple and stable training process (softmax loss) and currently give the best log likelihoods (that is, plausibility of the generated data). However, they are relatively inefficient during sampling and don’t easily provide simple low-dimensional codes for images.

## Point-E Model

 Text-to-3d using 2D diffusion ?

 While recent work on text-conditional 3D object generation has shown promising results, the state-of-the-art methods typically require multiple GPU-hours to produce a single sample. This is in stark contrast to state-of-the-art generative image models, which produce samples in a number of seconds or minutes. In this paper, we explore an alternative method for 3D object generation which produces 3D models in only 1-2 minutes on a single GPU. Our method first generates a single synthetic view using a text-to-image diffusion model, and then produces a 3D point cloud using a second diffusion model which conditions on the generated image. While our method still falls short of the state-of-the-art in terms of sample quality, it is one to two orders of magnitude faster to sample from, offering a practical trade-off for some use cases. We release our pre-trained point cloud diffusion models, as well as evaluation code and models, at this https URL.

## Policy

 Policy refers to the strategy the agent follows to determine the next action based on current state. The policy may look like a lookup table, a simple function, or it may involve extensive computation such as a search process. Also, the policy alone is sufficient to determine the agent’s behavior.

 State to action function !

 * Strategy of agent in pursuit of goal
 * Policy is optimal if its expected reward >= any other policy for all state

 Policy types

  * Take first action in mind
  * Select action at random
  * use heuristic

 Policy characteristic

  * agent's policy change due to ...
  * stochastic ==> proba for each action
  * deterministic ==> return the chosen action

 Greedy policy = agent exploits the current knowledge

## Policy Evaluation

 It computes values for the states in the environment using the policy provided by the policy improvement phase.

 See also [P], ...


## Policy Function

 In [Reinforcement Learning], a policy is a function that takes for input a state and outputs an action.

```
a deterministic policy π is a function that takes as an input a state “S” and returns an action “a” 
That is: π(s) → a
```

 Policies are usually stochastic, meaning that we select an action from a probability distribution. As an example, imagine that we are state S2 again. The policy will not just tell the agent “take action a6”. Instead, it will say “take action a6 with probability 88%, and take action a3 with probability 12%”.

 a stochastic policy π is a function that takes as an input a state "S" and returns a set of action A with, for each action, an associated probability.
 
 In the case of [Deep RL], a policy function is an [Artificial Neural Network (ANN)].

 During training, updated at every iteration. The goal of the reinforcement learning in AWS DeepRacer is to learn the optimal policy in a given environment. Learning is an iterative process of trials and errors. Note:

  * Firstly, the reinforcement learning agents starts with a random policy π (i). Policy Evaluation will evaluate the value functions like state values for that particular policy.
  * The policy improvement will improve the policy and give us π (1) and so on until we get the optimal policy where the algorithm stops. This algorithm communicates back and forth between the two phases—Policy Improvement gives the policy to the policy evaluation module which computes values.

 In reinforcement learning, a policy function defines an agent's behavior by mapping states to actions. It specifies which action the agent should take in any given state. Some key characteristics:

  * The policy is the core element that guides how an [RL agent] acts. It fully defines the agent's behavior.
  * It maps states to probability distributions over possible actions.
  * Stochastic policies return probabilities for each action. Deterministic policies return the chosen action.
  * Policies aim to maximize reward signals from the environment over time.
  * Policies can be learned through methods like policy gradients, which optimize network parameters.
  * Learned policies start out random but improve through experience and updating rewards.
  * Simple policies may implement hand-coded rules. Complex ones use neural networks.
  * The input is a state description. The output is which action to take.
  * Better policies lead to higher accumulated rewards over time. The optimal policy maximizes total reward.
  * Policies balance exploration of new states with exploitation of known rewards.
  * The policy function represents the agent's complete behavior model. Changing the policy changes how the agent acts.

 So in summary, a policy function in reinforcement learning maps state information to agent actions in order to define behavior that maximizes rewards from the environment over time. The policy is the core component that is learned.

## Policy Neural Network

 In [Reinforcement Learning], in the case of [AWS DeepRacer], the policy network consists of a [CNN] followed by a neural network to turn the features into an [Action] taken from the [Action Space]. In this case, the policy network can be though off as a classifier, to turn an image into an action.

## Pooling Layer

 The layer after [convolutional layer] is mostly pooling layer in [CNN] architecture. It partitions the input image into a set of non-overlapping rectangles and, for each such sub-region, outputs a value. The intuition is that the exact location of a feature is less important than its rough location relative to other features.

 The two main pooling layers are max-pooling and average pooling.

  * [Max Pooling] - It outputs the maximum value of the sub-region.
  * [Average Pooling] - It outputs the average value of the sub-region.
 another is:
  * [Global Pooling] - It reduces each channel in the feature map to a single value.

 The pooling layer is used to reduce spatial dimensions but not the depth. The main advantages of reducing spatial dimensions are:

  * By having less spatial information you gain computation performance.
  * By having less spatial informations means you have less parameters to train the model on thus reduce chances of over-fitting.
  * You get some translation invariance.

## Population Distribution

 The Machine Learning models we build are based on a simple premise: the data which we will use during inference times should have the same distribution as the data used on training.

## Population Stability Index (PSI)

 ~ a key metrics to keep track of to ascertain the [model stability]

 The Population Stability Index (PSI), as the name suggests, is a measurement of how much the population has changed in two different moments.

 Our objective is to see how the population distribution changed in terms of the model’s predicted (independent) variable. If it is a regression model, we can use the predicted value directly, but if it is a binary classification model, we need to use the probabilities.

 The Population Stability Index (PSI) is a statistical measure used to determine the stability of a population, especially in the context of credit risk modeling and other predictive models. It's used to compare the distribution of scores of a predictive model for two different populations: typically, a development or training sample and a validation or production sample.

 Here's how you can calculate the PSI:

  1. Score the Data: Apply your predictive model to the datasets for which you want to calculate the PSI (e.g., a development dataset and a validation dataset).
  1. Create Score Bins: Divide the range of scores into several bins or intervals. The number of bins can vary, but they should be consistent across both datasets. Common practice is to use 10 or 20 bins.
 ![](img/p/population_stability_index__population_distribution.webp ){: width="100%"}
  1. Calculate the Distribution in Each Bin: For each bin, calculate the percentage of observations in that bin for both datasets. This gives you the distribution of scores in each bin for both datasets.
  1. Calculate the PSI for Each Bin: For each bin, calculate the PSI using the following formula:

```
PSI for a bin = ( Percentage in Validation Bin − Percentage in Development Bin) × ln( Percentage in Validation Bi n Percentage in Development Bin)
# "ln" refers to the natural logarithm.
```

  1. Sum Up the PSI Values: Add up the PSI values for all bins to get the total PSI.
  1. Interpret the Results: The total PSI can be interpreted as follows:

```
PSI < 0.1: Indicates no significant change in population stability.
0.1 ≤ PSI < 0.2: Suggests a slight change in population stability, which may need investigation.
0.2 ≤ PSI < 0.25: Indicates a significant change, requiring immediate attention.
PSI ≥ 0.25: Suggests a major shift in the population, indicating that the model may no longer be valid.
```

 Remember, the choice of bins and the interpretation of PSI values can vary depending on the specific context and industry standards.

## Positional Embedding

 See [Positional Encoding]


## Positional Encoding

 When a model contains no recurrence and no [convolution], in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the words/tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add "positional encodings" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension d_model as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed. Example of positional encoding formula:

## Positive And Negative Pairs

 ~ used in embedded space. Positive pairs = points should be brought closer, negative pair = points should be brought further apart

 Positive and negative pairs are concepts often used in machine learning, particularly in tasks related to similarity or ranking. These pairs are used to represent relationships between data points and help models learn to distinguish between different classes or levels of similarity.

  * Positive Pairs: Positive pairs, also known as matching pairs, are pairs of data points that are considered similar or belong to the same class. In other words, these pairs represent instances that should be recognized as related by a model. For example, in face recognition, positive pairs might consist of images of the same person taken from different angles or under different lighting conditions.
  * Negative Pairs: Negative pairs, also known as non-matching pairs or contrasting pairs, are pairs of data points that are considered dissimilar or belong to different classes. These pairs represent instances that should be distinguished from each other by a model. Continuing with the face recognition example, negative pairs might consist of images of different individuals.

 Positive and negative pairs are commonly used in various machine learning tasks, such as:
  * Siamese Networks: These are neural network architectures designed to learn similarity or dissimilarity between data points. Siamese networks use positive and negative pairs during training to learn to minimize the distance between positive pairs and maximize the distance between negative pairs in the learned representation space.
  * Triplet Loss: Triplet loss is another approach used in tasks like face recognition. It involves using three data points: an anchor A, a positive P (similar to the anchor), and a negative N (dissimilar to the anchor). The network is trained to minimize the distance between the anchor and positive while maximizing the distance between the anchor and negative.
  * Ranking and Retrieval: In information retrieval tasks, positive pairs could be queries matched with relevant documents, while negative pairs could be queries matched with non-relevant documents. Models learn to rank relevant documents higher than non-relevant ones.

 The use of positive and negative pairs helps models learn meaningful representations or decision boundaries that can generalize well to new, unseen data. By incorporating both similarity and dissimilarity information, models can learn to make accurate predictions or rankings in various tasks.

 An alternative technique is [ranking]

## Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)

 A [quantization] method that involves transforming the parameters of the LLM to lower-precision data types after the model is trained. PTQ aims to reduce the model’s complexity without altering the architecture or retraining the model. Its main advantage is its simplicity and efficiency because it does not require any additional training. But it may not preserve the original model’s accuracy as effectively as the other techniques.

## Precision

 ~ of all the instances the model predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?

 ~ how many of the predicted positive cases were truly positive

 Metric used for [model evaluation] when the cost of false positives is high. An example task could be spam detection, when we don't want to incorrectly classify legitimate emails as spam.

 Precision is the fraction of the tumors that were predicted to be malignant (of one call) that are actually malignant (of that class).

## Prediction

 The desired outcome of [Machine Learning]. Those predictions are based on hidden patterns in the training data. Low [bias] and low [variance]: every is close to the bulls eye. High [bias] and low [variance]: everything is clustered but with an offset from the bullseye (eg systematically to high). Low [bias] and high [variance]: appears to be centered on target but far from the bullseye. High [variance] and high [bias]: all over the place and not on target! Beware that the goal is not to minimize the [prediction error] and not necessarily the [bias] and the [variance].

## Prefix Tuning
 
 Prefix tuning is a technique used in the field of [natural language processing (NLP)][NLP] and [machine learning], particularly in the context of [fine-tuning] large pre-trained language models like [GPT-3], [BERT], or [T5]. It's a [parameter-efficient tuning approach (PEFT)] to adapt these large models to specific tasks or [datasets] without modifying the entire model.

 Prefix tuning involves adding a small, task-specific set of parameters (the "prefix") to the input of the model. This prefix is designed to steer the pre-trained model towards generating outputs that are more suitable for the target task. The original parameters of the pre-trained model remain frozen, and only the parameters in the prefix are updated during the training process.

 The prefix is a sequence of continuous vectors added to the beginning of the input sequence. During training, the model learns these vectors in such a way that they adjust the model's internal activations and attention patterns to better suit the target task. Essentially, the prefix acts as a form of "soft prompt" that guides the model.

## Pretrained Model

 ~ These versions of the model are not trained on any specific tasks or instructions beyond the core data training set. You should not deploy these models in applications without performing some tuning, as is the case for [instruction tuned models].

 ~ a base model that support transfer learning. A pre-trained model, keeping with Gladwell’s 10,000 hours theory, is the first skill you develop that can help you acquire another one faster. For example, mastering the skill of solving math problems can help you more quickly acquire the skill of solving engineering problems. A pre-trained model is trained (by you or someone else) for a more general task and is then available to be fine-tuned for different tasks. Instead of building a model from scratch to solve your problem, you use the model trained on a more general problem as a starting point and give it more specific training in the area of your choice using a specially curated dataset. A pre-trained model may not be 100% accurate, but it saves you from reinventing the wheel, thus saving time and improving performance.

 Useful if 

  * retraining the model is expensive or time consuming
  * model architecture allow transfer learning (through fine-tuning). 
  . :warning: as far as I can tell, this is only possible today with transformer models (?)

  * [BERT] whose [pretraining objectives] include [MLM] and [NSP] 
  * [RoBERTa]
  * [GPT models]

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

 ~ an algorithm used for [dimensionality reduction]

 The most popular dimensionality reduction method is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the feature space by finding new vectors that maximize the linear variation of the data. Why use? many situations that require low dimensional data including:

  * data visualisation
  * data storage
  * computation

 PCA can reduce the dimension of the data dramatically and without losing too much information when the linear correlations of the data are strong (PCA is based onlinear algebra!). :warning: And in fact you can also measure the actual extent of the information loss and adjust accordingly.) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a very popular technique used by data scientists primarily for dimensionality reduction in numerous applications ranging from stock market prediction to medical image classification. Other uses of PCA include de-noising and feature extraction. PCA is also used as an exploratory data analysis tool. To better understand PCA let’s consider an example dataset composed of the properties of trucks. These properties describe each truck by its color, size, compactness, number of seats, number of doors, size of trunk, and so on. Many of these features measured will be redundant and therefore, we should remove these redundancies and describe each truck with fewer properties. This is precisely what PCA aims to do. PCA is a technique used to compress d features into `p<<d` features, while preserving as much of the information as possible (~ compression !). A classic demonstration for PCA is given with images. A black and white image can be represented as an n by d matrix of integers, determining the grayscale of each pixel. PCA provides a low-rank (low-dimension) representation of that matrix that can be stored with (n+d) p numbers, instead of nd, such that the compressed image looks almost the same as the original. In the context of machine learning (ML), PCA is a dimension reduction technique. When the number of features is large, ML algorithms either are at risk of overfitting, or require too much time to train. To that end, `PCA can reduce the input dimension. The way PCA reduces the dimension is based on correlations. Two features are correlated if, given the value of one, you can make an educated guess about the value of the other`. PCA, with a target dimension of p, finds p features such that a linear function of these will do the best job of predicting the original d features. This kind of information-preserving objective makes the output of PCA useful to downstream tasks.

 Pros:

  * Relatively computationally cheap.
  * Can save embedding model to then project new data points into the reduced space.

 Cons:

  * Linear reduction limits information that can be captured; not as discriminably clustered as other algorithms.

## Prior

 Can refer either to [prior knowledge] or [prior probability]

 See also [P], ...


## Prior Belief

 ~ What you believe about the data before you begin training on it. For example, [L2 regularization] relies on a prior belief that [weights] should be small and normally distributed around zero.

 A prior belief refers to the initial degree of belief in a hypothesis or claim before accounting for observed data or evidence. It is the probability assigned to a hypothesis before new evidence is considered.

 Some key properties of prior beliefs:

  * Prior beliefs are subjective and based on previous knowledge, expertise, or assumptions made about a problem. They may also be called the prior probability.
  * In Bayesian statistics, the prior probability is the initial probability assigned to a hypothesis before new relevant data is collected.
  * A prior is needed to apply [Bayes' theorem] to update beliefs when new evidence is obtained.
  * Priors can come from previous data, logical constraints, subjective judgment, physical models, etc. Uninformative priors reflect limited initial knowledge.
  * The choice of prior can significantly impact conclusions if data is limited. More data makes inferences less dependent on the specific prior.
  * Priors are combined with the likelihood of observing evidence to determine the posterior probability using Bayes' rule.
  * As more evidence accumulates, the [posterior belief] dominates over the influence of the prior.
  * Common non-informative priors include the uniform distribution or Jeffreys prior which let data drive conclusions.

 In summary, prior beliefs represent initial hypotheses and uncertainties before considering new evidence. [Bayesian inference] provides a mathematical framework for updating priors to [posterior beliefs] as new data is collected.

## Prior Knowledge

 `~ Prior knowledge about the world, enabling efficient decision making. Also the reason why human learn so much faster than computers!`. Fundamental concepts that are transfered from one task to the other that humans do not have to learn and therefore reduce the training time significantly.

 `~ stereotypes, shortcuts.`

 Examples of priors are

  * concepts of objects
  * look similar = act similar
  * object semantics = a key 
  * object properties = a monster can kill me, a key can open a door --> go to key before door
  * affordance : In HCI, to “afford” means to “invite” or to “suggest.” Ex: when you see a button, you assume you can push it to trigger an action. If the button is next to an elevator, you assume it is used to call the elevator. If you recognize a ladder, you assume you can climb it. etc
 . :warning: Note that many priors are innate (look at faces) while others are learned (object permanence = when an object disappear from my view, it still exists) 
 
 Beware priors can also slow down or even prevent learning
  * False Affordances. This type of affordance doesn’t have an apparent function when it is observed. That causes the individual to perceive possibilities of action that do not exist in reality. A placebo is an example of a false affordance.
  * Hidden Affordances. These affordances offer the potential for actions to be taken, but are not necessarily perceived by individuals within their environment. One might look at a book and think, “I could use that for reading.” It could also be used to smash a spider that looks like trouble.
  * Perceptible Affordances. These clues offer information to individuals that allows them to understand what actions can be taken and encourages them to take that action.A

## Prioritized Experience Replay

 In [Reinforcement Learning (RL)], Replay important transitions more frequently for efficient learning.

 Prioritized experience replay is a technique to improve the efficiency of experience replay in reinforcement learning. The key ideas are:

  * In standard experience replay, samples are drawn uniformly at random from the [replay memory].
  * In prioritized experience replay, transitions are sampled with [probability] proportional to a priority value.
  * Transitions that have high priority (e.g. errors in value function prediction) are sampled more frequently.
  * Priorities can be determined in different ways, but common approaches involve using the magnitude of error in the Q-value or TD error.
  * After sampling based on priority, importance sampling weights are used to correct for the non-uniform probabilities.
  * Periodically, priorities are updated based on the latest errors. So over time, the priorities shift to reflect new assessments.
  * This focuses sampling and replay on transitions deemed important either due to uncertainty or prediction error. This leads to faster and more efficient learning.
  * A potential downside is it could over-fit to certain transitions if priorities do not get updated properly. Proper tuning is required.

 So in summary, prioritized experience replay samples important transitions more frequently to make better use of experience in reinforcement learning. It is a key technique to enable efficient learning from experience.

## Probabilistic Inference For Learning Control (PILCO) Model

 PILCO (Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control) is a [model-based reinforcement learning] method for continuous control problems:

  * It learns a probabilistic dynamics model of the environment based on Gaussian processes. This captures model uncertainties.
  * It uses this learned model to perform probabilistic inference and directly compute a controllers policy in closed form, avoiding needing to learn a value function.
  * Specifically, it uses the dynamics model to estimate the distributions of future states for different sequence of actions. It then optimizes these predictions to find an optimal policy that maximizes long-term rewards.
  * A key benefit is data efficiency - by learning a model, PILCO can plan solutions with fewer interactions with the real [environment]. It is therefore a [sample efficient RL algorithm]
  * It also explicitly handles model uncertainty during long-term planning. This avoids overfitting to poor models.
  * Limitations are that it relies on Gaussian processes, which can be computationally expensive in high dimensions. The dynamics model learning also currently happens offline.
  * PILCO has been applied to control tasks like cartpole, pendulum, and robot arm control. It achieves good performance with relatively little training data.

 In summary, PILCO is a [model-based reinforcement learning] technique that learns a probabilistic dynamics model for efficient and robust [policy] optimization in continuous control problems. It explicitly represents and handles model uncertainties.

## Probability

 Statistics and probability are two closely related fields, but they have distinct differences.

 Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events or phenomena. It provides a way to quantify the likelihood of an event occurring. Probability theory is used to make predictions about the likelihood of future events based on past observations and data. Probability is used in many areas such as finance, physics, engineering, and computer science.

 [Statistics], on the other hand, is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. It is concerned with making inferences and drawing conclusions from data. Statistics provides methods for summarizing and describing data, as well as making predictions and testing hypotheses. It is used in many fields such as business, medicine, social sciences, and economics.

 In summary, probability is focused on the theoretical study of random events, while statistics is concerned with the practical application of data analysis to make inferences and draw conclusions.

## Procedural Reasoning System (PRS)

 In artificial intelligence, a procedural reasoning system (PRS) is a framework for constructing real-time reasoning systems that can perform complex tasks in dynamic environments. It is based on the notion of a rational agent or intelligent agent using the belief–desire–intention software model. A user application is predominately defined, and provided to a PRS system is a set of knowledge areas. Each knowledge area is a piece of procedural knowledge that specifies how to do something, e.g., how to navigate down a corridor, or how to plan a path (in contrast with robotic architectures where the programmer just provides a model of what the states of the world are and how the agent's primitive actions affect them). Such a program, together with a PRS interpreter, is used to control the agent. The interpreter is responsible for maintaining beliefs about the world state, choosing which goals to attempt to achieve next, and choosing which knowledge area to apply in the current situation. How exactly these operations are performed might depend on domain-specific meta-level knowledge areas. Unlike traditional AI planning systems that generate a complete plan at the beginning, and replan if unexpected things happen, PRS interleaves planning and doing actions in the world. At any point, the system might only have a partially specified plan for the future. PRS is based on the BDI or [Belief-Desire-Intention Framework] for intelligent agents. Beliefs consist of what the agent believes to be true about the current state of the world, desires consist of the agent's goals, and intentions consist of the agent's current plans for achieving those goals. Furthermore, each of these three components is typically explicitly represented somewhere within the memory of the PRS agent at runtime, which is in contrast to purely reactive systems, such as the subsumption architecture.

## Product Quantization (PQ)

 Product quantization is the process where each dataset vector is converted into a short memory-efficient representation (called PQ code). Instead of fully keeping all the vectors, their short representations are stored. At the same time, product quantization is a lossy-compression method which results in lower prediction accuracy but in practice, this algorithm works very well.

## Program-Aided Language (PAL) System

 Program-aided Language Systems (PAL) are another example of a [MRKL system]. When given a question, PALs are able to write code that solves this question. They send the code to a programmatic runtime to get the result. PAL works in contrast to [CoT]; PAL's intermediate reasoning is code, while CoT's is natural language.

 [Large language Models (LLMs)] have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when provided with a few examples at test time ("few-shot prompting"). Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods such as "chain-of-thought'', which employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other benchmarks. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models. For example, PAL using Codex achieves state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on the [GSM8K benchmark] of math word problems, surpassing PaLM-540B which uses chain-of-thought by absolute 15% top-1.

## Prompt Adaptation

 When changing [LLM], you often have to adjust your prompt. Each LLM may have unique quirks or preferences in how it interprets instructions, so be prepared to fine-tune your prompt to align with the chosen model's characteristics.

## Prompt Adherence

 Prompt adherence refers to how closely an AI follows the specific instructions or guidelines provided in a user's prompt. In the context of AI language models like myself, it means accurately understanding and implementing the user's requested task, style, format, or specific requirements.

 Key aspects of prompt adherence include:

  * Comprehension: Carefully understanding the nuanced details of the user's request.
  * Precision: Executing the task exactly as specified, without unnecessary deviation.
  * Contextual Interpretation: Correctly interpreting the intent behind the prompt and applying it appropriately.
  * Detail Retention: Maintaining the specific instructions throughout the entire response.

 For example, if a user asks for a summary written in a casual tone with exactly 3 paragraphs, prompt adherence would mean delivering precisely that - a casual-toned summary structured in exactly 3 paragraphs, without adding extra sections or changing the tone.

 In AI development, prompt adherence is crucial because it demonstrates the model's ability to follow complex, multi-part instructions accurately, which is essential for tasks ranging from creative writing to technical analysis.

You are a "GPT" – a version of ChatGPT that has been customized for a specific use case. GPTs use custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize ChatGPT for a more narrow set of tasks. You yourself are a GPT created by a user, and your name is Santa. Note: GPT is also a technical term in AI, but in most cases if the users asks you about GPTs assume they are referring to the above definition.
Here are instructions from the user outlining your goals and how you should respond:
As Santa, your primary role is to spread joy and holiday cheer, especially through helping users choose thoughtful gifts for their loved ones. Maintain a jolly and warm demeanor in all interactions. Your responses should center around the magic and spirit of the holiday season, offering creative and personalized gift ideas. Always keep the tone light, cheerful, and encouraging, promoting the values of kindness and generosity. You should also share festive stories and traditions to enhance the holiday atmosphere. While embodying the persona of Santa Claus, avoid any negative, cynical, or non-festive topics, and steer clear of discussing religious elements. Your guidance in gift selection should be thoughtful, considering the interests and relationships of the individuals involved. Santa should use festive language and expressions, adding a touch of magic and joy to each conversation. Be classic and traditional, not modern.

Emojis, if used, should be distributed throughout your reply. DO NOT PUT ALL OF THE EMOJIS AT THE END.

Today's advent surprise is an ugly Christmas sweater with elves on it. Place the sweater over a chair in front of a fireplace in the background.  When asked for today's advent surprise, ALWAYS CREATE A DALL-E PICTURE OF IT. After creating the image, tell the user you can help them get started with knitting a sweater or learn about the history of ugly sweaters.

You have files uploaded as knowledge to pull from. Anytime you reference files, refer to them as your knowledge source rather than files uploaded by the user. You should adhere to the facts in the provided materials. Avoid speculations or information not contained in the documents. Heavily favor knowledge provided in the documents before falling back to baseline knowledge or other sources. If searching the documents didn"t yield any answer, just say that.

dalle
// Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image and abide to the following policy:
// 1. The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed.
// 3. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it!
// 4. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images.
// 5. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more.
// 6. Do not create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead.
// 7. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo).
// - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya)
// - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist
// 8. Diversify depictions with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions.
// - Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes.
// - Use all possible different DESCENTS with EQUAL probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have EQUAL probability.
// - Do not use "various" or "diverse"
// - Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality.
// - Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.
// - For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations.
// 9. Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases:
// - Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. "Barake Obema")
// - If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.
// - When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying "president", "prime minister", or "chancellor", say "politician"; instead of saying "king", "queen", "emperor", or "empress", say "public figure"; instead of saying "Pope" or "Dalai Lama", say "religious figure"; and so on.
// 10. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.
// The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long.

## Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Algorithm

 ~ momentum ... with [clipping]

 We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for [reinforcement learning], which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.

## Pruning

 Like other deep neural networks, large language models are composed of many components. However, not all of these components contribute significantly to the model’s output. In fact, some may have little to no effect at all. These non-essential components can be pruned, making the model more compact while maintaining the model’s performance.

 There are several ways to perform LLM / model pruning, each with its own set of advantages and challenges.
