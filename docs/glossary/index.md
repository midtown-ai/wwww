    This groundbreaking architecture was introduced in 2017 by researchers at [Google] in the paper titled "Attention Is All You Need." It replaced traditional [recurrent][RNN] and [convolutional][CNN] models in tasks like [machine translation] and text generation by relying entirely on [self-attention] mechanisms, allowing for parallel processing and significantly faster training. It serves as the foundation for modern models like [GPT] and [BERT].

    ---

    This ensemble learning method, introduced by Leo Breiman in 2001, is used for both [classification] and [regression] tasks. It works by constructing multiple [decision trees] during training and outputs the majority vote for classification or the average prediction for regression. Known for its [robustness] and [accuracy], this method reduces [overfitting] and improves predictive performance by combining the results of individual trees.
