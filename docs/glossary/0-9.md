# 0-9

## 0-1 Loss Function

 One of the simplest loss function that is calculated based on accuracy.

 ==this model classified 7 objects correctly (assigned them the correct class labels) and 3 objects incorrectly.
So my loss function would return "0" 7 times and "1" 3 times 
Your 1's become indicators for misclassified items, regardless of how they were misclassified. (could be many classes)==

## 3D Autoencoders

 A specialized form of two-part [neural network] that includes an “encoder” and a “decoder.” The [encoder] transforms the initial data into a smaller depiction. The [decoder] tries to reconstitute the original data from the depiction, restoring it to its original state.
