## Report

 The 2023 Expert Survey on Progress in AI, involving 2,778 AI researchers, features the fragmented views within the AI science community regarding the risks and opportunities of AI development. About 35% of respondents favor either a slower or faster development pace than currently observed, with the “much faster” group being three times larger than the “much slower” group. The survey predicts advancements in AI advancements by 2028, with milestones like autonomously creating websites and composing music expected to be achieved much earlier than previous estimates. By 2047, there’s a 50% probability that AI systems will surpass human performance in all tasks.
