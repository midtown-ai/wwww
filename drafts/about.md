# Our story {: .center-text }


In the late summer 2022, in Palo Alto, a father wanted to mentor his son who was then in middle school at JLS. As an engineer, the father saw AI as the technology of the future and wanted to channel his son's interest and passion by teaching him what he knew. Together they began reading their [first AI paper](https://rachit-dubey.github.io/humanRL_website/) and tinkering with fun coding and [non-coding](https://cola.midtown.ai/) projects.

With the emergence of diffusion and transformer models, particularly chatGPT, other young students in the midtown Palo Alto area also expressed fascination with AI. As a result, the father-son duo decided to invite middle-school peers and friends to form a community to explore this subject. What began as an informal gathering gradually evolved into what we now know as Midtown AI.

Running the club has been an incredible journey for the busy father. There were definitely challenges balancing his work while managing the club. However, the students' contagious enthusiasm and engagement made every effort worthwhile. One of his most cherished memories was witnessing the students role-playing as AI startup CEOs, pitching hypothetical investors for founding. That day, the student's dedication, creativity, and passion on display exemplified why the club's community is so special. Watching 11 to 14-year-olds deliver thoughtful presentations and field tough questions to raise "millions" for their imaginary startups was not only fun, but also eye-opening, as it showcased the immense potential of the students.

On the first year, we only served middle school students. The following year, given the 8th-grader participants had graduated, Midtown AI is now also welcoming high schoolers.

For the school year 2023-2024, to continue developing AI knowledge and skills, students are offered 5 tracks:

* [Math Circle](/tracks/math_circle.md#) - Build a solid math foundation by discovering or rediscovering linear algebra, statistics, probability, and calculus!
* [Engineering](/tracks/engineering.md) - Build end-to-end AI applications using Python, deep learning and other technical skills.
* [Business + Leadership](/tracks/business.md#) - Develop strategic thinking and leadership abilities to complement technical skills.
* [Research](/tracks/research.md#) - Dive into seminal and cutting edge AI papers, replicate results, and potentially pursue own research.
* [DeepRacer Student League](/tracks/deepracer.md#) - Program a self-driving car, compete and race against others

The educational tracks are designed and sequenced so that no prior experience is necessary to join. We provide the tutorials and mentoring help for students to get up to speed. All they need is an interest in AI and a willingness to learn!

## Advisers {: .center-text }

To increase our impact, our aspiration is to extend our reach further than the Palo Alto School District and support AI education for teachers and students in all high schools within the Silicon Valley. Institutions such as East Palo Alto Academy, Fremont High School, Sequoia High School in Redwood City are next on our list. Join us in realizing our mission to make AI accessible to all, our vision of "AI for ALL".
